===== Notes =====
ES3.1. spec: It will be created as a separate doc by marking up the ES3 document. We’ll need a "summary of changes" doc, too. As we get agreement on 1 and 3 we should start incorporating it into the ES3.1 spec.

**Prep for ES3.1 vs ES4 reconciliation**

Lets discuss this at the TC39 F2F tomorrow

**Organizing spec writing effort**

Allen: Meta - how to provide meta operations like defining property getters/setters, etc

pratapL: Date - can spend about 2 days a week – Date

Doug: can spend 1 day a week

Kris: getters/setters - can spend couple of hours a week

Mark: fix, freeze - will not be able to spend time writing - can review content – will help pin down on security aspects

Collin: [[proposals:versioning|version conditioning]]

pratapL will maintain the latest stable version of the spec. ES3 will be base the doc.

**Separating Meta**

Kris: Discussion on getters/setters, how to simulate it using catchall, the need for definegetter/definesetter in ES4

Allen: It can also be implemented using Meta

All: Suggested syntax looks like the following:

<code>
Meta.defineProperty(myObj,
                       { name : "foo", setter : function (val) { /* */ }}
                   )
myObj.foo = x;
</code>

**Run through deviations doc**

Mark/Allen: Discussion on Object.fix and Object.freeze and how it can be implemented using Meta

Mark/Allen/Doug/pratapL: detailed updates to the deviations doc (that pratapL will update on the wiki)

**Discuss candidate extensions**

Deferred.

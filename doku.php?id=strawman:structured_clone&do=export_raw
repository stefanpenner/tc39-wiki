===== GitHub =====

For now we maintain this here: https://github.com/dslomov-chromium/ecmascript-structured-clone

===== Objective =====

The idea of this proposal is to embrace and extend (per Brendan we forget about the third word) [[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#transferable-objects|structured clones and transferable objects]] currently defined in HTML.

In other words, it puts the mechanics for cloning and transferring objects in JavaScript proper. Rather than having an algorithm that handles all objects and primitive values, we put the mechanics on the objects instead and let objects opt into supporting being cloned and/or transferred.

The key value of having this specification under the auspices of TC39 and not HTML spec is being able to accommodate further additions to ECMAScript language into Structured Clone algorithm, such as symbols, proxies, typed objects etc.



===== Proposal =====

To be found here: https://github.com/dslomov-chromium/ecmascript-structured-clone/blob/master/README.md

===== Future =====

As a next step we could look into what it would take to make these user-extensible. That would involve defining some kind of clone/transfer format or maybe magic and is therefore postponed for now.

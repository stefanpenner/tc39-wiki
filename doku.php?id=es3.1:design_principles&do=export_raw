The broad use of ES3 imposes constraints on how we can achieve the stated goals. The design principles we shall follow are:\\
(1) Primary focus is on correction of known errors and clarification of known ambiguities.\\
(2) New features only considered if:\\
(2a) They introduce no new syntax\\
(2b) Offer significant new value\\
(3) Prefer features that have been proven in existing implementations\\
(4) Features may be marked as deprecated if they are known to create significant security or reliability issues.\\
(4a) Consider deprecating features with minimal value that cause significant performance related issues.\\

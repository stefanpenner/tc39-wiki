====== Agenda ======

  * [Chris] We have multi-line strings using triple-quotes or backslash-newline.  So...
    - What does it mean to have backslash-newline //inside// a triple-quoted string?
    - What does it mean to have backslash-newline in a regexp literal with/without the following **x**?
  * [Cormac] [[proposals:argument this]] A suggestion to treat class methods via "argument this" (as opposed to "bound this"), for consistency with structural object types and ES3.






====== Notes =====

  * Dave has set up a new website, www.es-lang.org (we've also gotten Ecma approval to use www.ecmascript-lang.org), that we will use to post  builds of the reference implementation and also to host the issue tracking system. Dave installed Trac, which is an open source issue tracking system. Anyone can create a user account. Currently Dave, Francis and Jeff have administrative privileges. The link to the Trac system is under the "Development" section. 

  * [Chris] We have multi-line strings using triple-quotes or backslash-newline.  So...
    - What does it mean to have backslash-newline //inside// a triple-quoted string? RESOLVED: Should mean the same thing inside a single-quoted string.
    - What does it mean to have backslash-newline in a regexp literal with/without the following **x**?      RESOLVED: If you donâ€™t have \x flag you want it to be nothing, but if you do have \x flag you want a newline. 


  * [Cormac] [[proposals:argument this]] A suggestion to treat class methods via "argument this" (as opposed to "bound this"), for consistency with structural object types and ES3.
    * Consensus is that allowing bound this is very useful, but that we need new syntax for it.

The goal of ES3.1 is to make a minimal set of changes to ES3 to accomplish the following:

  - Browser implementation unification: Consider adopting features that are already implemented in 3 of the 4 browser brands, or that are deployed in 3 out 4 user computers and reduce cross browser incompatibilities.
  - ES3.1 shall improve the language to benefit casual developers by reducing confusing or troublesome constructs.
  - ES3.1 shall improve the language to benefit major websites by reducing confusing or troublesome constructs.
  - ES4 shall become a superset of ES3.1.
  - ES3.1 shall be a friendly base for a secure subset.
  - ES3.1 shall attempt to correct errors in ES3.
  - ES3.1 new features shall require concrete demonstrations.
  - ES3.1 may deprecate (or eliminate with opt-in) features that are problematic for performance, security, or reliability.
  - ES3.1 shall provide virtualizability, allowing for host object emulation.

<del>  - Improve implementation conformance by rewriting the specification to improve its rigor and clarity, and by correcting known points of ambiguity or under specification.
  - Add commonly implemented and used extensions to the standard (specifically most JavaScript 1.6 and 1.7 features)
  - Incorporate high leverage incremental extensions that support current usage experience and best practices
  - Adopt low impact language changes that correct well known performance or reliability issues
  - Identify problematic features to be designated as deprecated
  - Maximize both forward and backwards compatibility between ES3 and ES3.1 as well as between ES3.1 and ES4.</del>

===== Discussion =====

Based upon my current understanding of JS 1.6 and 1.7 as well as comments from Brendan about the experimental nature of some of the 1.7 features, I suggest that the second item be modified to say "JavaScript 1.5" rather than "1.6 and 1.7"

I agree. New keywords were added in JS1.7 ('let', yield'), and JS1.6 had E4X. Note though that JS1.6 introduced some Array extras too.

I'm curious how you plan to achieve host object emulation?

Do items 2 and 3 imply that 3.1 is a subset of ES3? Voltaire said "first define terms" (paraphrasing ;-)), so I am really asking what "reducing" means

In order to permit users to opt-in to ES3.1 it must have its own distinguished MIME type.

We ought to follow: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt. To quote from section 3://For the application/ecmascript media type, implementations MUST NOT process content labeled with a “version” parameter as if no such parameter had been specified; this is typically achieved by treating the content as unsupported. This error handling behavior allows extending the definition of the media type for content that cannot be processed by implementations of [ECMA].//

We should have "application/ecmascript;version=3.1" should mean ES3.1.

Note: Currently IE ignores the version parameter. This is true for both
<script type="text/javascript;version=1.5">...</script> and
<script language="JavaScript1.5">...</script>
Firefox too ignores the “1.5” in this deprecated language attribute’s value.

But for type=<xyz> the MIME type parameter should not be ignored.

<p>
 I&rsquo;ve read the <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> now and see nothing addressing the points i&rsquo;ve raised repeatedly. Instead I see what Wikipedia calls &ldquo;weasel words&rdquo;:

 Work item 3 – Creation of a new next generation browser programming language  (this item could possibly be merged with work item 2) </blockquote>
<blockquote>
 Some members of TC39-TG1 favor the creation of a new, less scripting focused, programming language  that could not only ultimately replace ECMAScript 3rd Edition as a webpage scripting language but could  also be used as a web browser implementation and extension language. This desire has been a  significant driver in the creation of the new “ECMAScript 4” language currently being designed in the  context of TC39-TG1.</blockquote>

<p>
 Who are these (multiple) &ldquo;Some members&rdquo; favoring &ldquo;a new next generation browser programming language&rdquo; for &ldquo;web browser implementation and extension&rdquo;? More honest language would have identified Mozilla, which is clearly the member you mean &ndash; but your weasel-worded assertion is false.
</p>

<p>
Nowhere in our requirements and rationales have we ever cited <acronym title="XML User Interface Language">XUL</acronym> scripting as a reason for any feature. Repeatedly we have cited the problems evident on the web with Ajax and <acronym title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</acronym> apps at scale: performance and programming in the large. Never has a use-case from Mozilla application code, e.g. the Firefox front end, been cited to justify anything. Nor were motivations presented by Mozilla people couched in terms abstracted from <acronym title="XML User Interface Language">XUL</acronym> requirements.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://intranet.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?id=discussion:versioning&amp;s=xul" class="urlextern" target="_blank" title="https://intranet.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?id=discussion:versioning&amp;s=xul" onclick="return svchk()" onkeypress="return svchk()" rel="nofollow">https://intranet.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?id=discussion:versioning&amp;s=xul</a> for the only hit searching for <acronym title="XML User Interface Language">XUL</acronym> finds in the wiki.
</p>

<p>
Here are the hits for &ldquo;Firefox&rdquo;: <a href="https://intranet.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?do=search&amp;id=Firefox" class="urlextern" target="_blank" title="https://intranet.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?do=search&amp;id=Firefox" onclick="return svchk()" onkeypress="return svchk()" rel="nofollow">https://intranet.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?do=search&amp;id=Firefox</a>
</p>

<p>
Of course, backward compatibility is important not only to allow an ES4 implementation to support ES3, for acceptable browser code size and download footprint. It&rsquo;s important for low-cost code migration, as we&rsquo;ve argued repeatedly in the wiki.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s hard to take this Work item 3 seriously, given the weasel words, the false charges, and the false dilemma between backward compatibility and acceptably clean language design.
</p>

<p>
Work item 1, cynically read, consists of asking Firefox to &ldquo;hold still at JS1.7&rdquo; while Microsoft catches up. But as noted in the <a href="doku.php%3Fid=discussion:versioning.html" class="wikilink1" title="discussion:versioning" onclick="return svchk()" onkeypress="return svchk()">versioning</a> page linked above, we have never proposed JS1.7 for standardization or usage on the web, and web authors know not to rely on it in cross-browser content. It&rsquo;s a non-issue.
</p>

<p>
Work item 2 seems to be based on the belief that an ECMA member wishing to standardize a variant of the ES4 proposals Waldemar and others developed in TG1 years ago should be approached as an exercise <strong>for that member only</strong>, without reference to other members who want to collaborate on the same kind of language (which indeed Microsoft JScript.NET in addition to Adobe ActionScript 3 implements), or to <strong>developers</strong> targeting programmed content at the Flash Player and the browsers, who would benefit from such an improved, common ECMAScript standard, which would facilitate code and knowledge sharing.
</p>

<p>
I reject this constraint on standardization. It seems to be selectively applied. It was not used during the evolution of C# to argue that major new editions of ECMA-335 should be separate specifications, even though only one vendor implemented such editions before adoption by ECMA, and such evolution changed the character of the language significantly
</p>

<p>
Even given such a false constraint on standardization, I can say, speaking for Mozilla, that we wish to collaborate with Adobe in ECMA TG1 on the successor to ES3 that we&rsquo;ve been working on lo these many years, with Microsoft&rsquo;s apparent participation.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s address the one technical and quantifiable objection from your paper.
</p>

<p>
Objecting that the change from ES3 to ES4 is &ldquo;too big&rdquo; without saying why size is an inherent problem begs all the questions I keep raising: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> how to address time, space, and programming-at-scale problems developers face every day writing <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> for web browsers;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> how other than by preserving compatibility to solve these problems without creating a new incompatible programming language that doubles the browser footprint hit and raises the migration cost to a rewrite tax;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the conflict of interest evident among the objecting members, who make or may endorse/consume, runtimes implementing languages with very similar features to the ones in draft ES4.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 In order to avoid broken consensus and hard feelings, we would do better to talk about concrete costs and benefits of evolving ES3 in a larger step, vs. smaller steps.
</p>

<p>
Work item 1 says something about performance, but it&rsquo;s extremely vague. <strong>What</strong> would it do, concretely, to address the problems with performance encountered when scaling web apps: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> object allocation overhead, both time and space</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~3x worse overhead using closures for information hiding compared to no closures and no hiding, or AS3-compiled private fields</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 10x or worse performance compared to easily-jitted statically typed languages that are mooted against ES3 (e.g. C#) or  improved from it (AS3 under strict mode).</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 How would small changes allowed by work item 1 address the programming-in-the-large problems encountered building web apps? 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Non-existent control over type name mutability</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Weak, cooperative conventions for sharing a single namespace</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Objects as namespaces without visibility and access controls</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Enforcing type and value constraints at <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> boundaries without type annotations</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Migrating old code to new, mixing old and new during migration, with partial type and value constraint enforcement</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 I&rsquo;m willing to spend some time arguing based on specific solutions to these problems, but I strongly suspect that a genuine attempt to solve these problems would end up reinventing large parts of ES4.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m more than a little cynical about spending too much time arguing with the contention that the bulleted items listed above aren&rsquo;t really problems on the web, when my interlocuters work for vendors producing and/or consuming alternative web-browser-like runtimes that support, or will support, languages that take these problems seriously, and which out-perform ES3 by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
But try me, for a little while. Make specific, testable claims. Just don&rsquo;t repeat vague or specious reasons from that <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>.

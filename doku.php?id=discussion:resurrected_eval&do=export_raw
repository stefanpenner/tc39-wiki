====== eval by any other name ======

It turns out that many crunched Ajax apps (certainly google.com ones) do things like ''Da=eval; ... d=Da(e)''. Now at least Mozilla-based browsers, Netscape included in the old days, will not reflect local names (var and formal parameters) that have been optimized to slots into the dynamic scope of such an indirect ''eval''. Yet such web apps work. Clearly, they want eval with global scope only. We should specify and support this. Objections?

====== Resolved issues ======

Is the ''eval(s,a)'' proposal worth anything?  In practice, built-ins used in the evaluated string will access properties on the original global object (eg, "new Object" will get the Object prototype from the original global object).  So the security provided is illusory without further fixes, probably.

I think that would be a useful thing, in that it gives a little bit more control of the context given to eval. But as you suggest, it doesn't get us nearly far enough.

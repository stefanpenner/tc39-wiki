====== Number.EPSILON ======

It is proposed that an ''EPSILON'' property be added to the ''Number'' constructor. Its value is approximately 2.220446049250313e-16, being that smallest number that, when added to 1.0, produces a result that is larger than 1.0.

It can be implemented like this:

    Number.EPSILON = (function () {
        var next, result;
        for (next = 1; 1 + next !== 1; next = next / 2) {
            result = next;
        }
        return result;
    }());

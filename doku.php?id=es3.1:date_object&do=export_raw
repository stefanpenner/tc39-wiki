//Description//: ECMAScript 3rd Edition (ES3) does not specify the syntax for date and time literals in 15.9.4.2. This is a source of ambiguity. Implementations have diverged and have come to use many heuristics for parsing date-time formats. This proposal attempts to specify a format for the date and time literals. 
I have looked at Lars' proposal for ES4 and tried to keep this compatible.

Relevant Goal: [[es3.1:es3.1_goals|2, 4, 6]]\\
Relevant Design Principle: [[es3.1:design_principles|1]]\\
Relevant ES4 proposal: [[proposals:date_and_time|date and time]] (wiki proposal could be out-of-date; Lars has the latest version)\\
Trac ticket: [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/129|#129]], [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/134|#134]]

I have extracted the Date portion of the ES3 spec, added a rationale of the ES3.1 proposal (with hyperlinks) at the beginning, and made relevant changes to the included section 15.9 text. Where I have deleted text belonging to the ES3 spec, I have added appropriate comments. Revision tracking is ON.

Two updates based on feedback from Lars â€“ added optional millisec field, reverted a change to the
Date ctor called as a function (15.9.2.1), minor typographic cleanup. The links above point to the updated doc.

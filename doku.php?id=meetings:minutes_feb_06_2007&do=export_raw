===== Agreements =====

  * unreformed ''with'' is forbidden in strict mode, but [[proposals:reformed with|reformed with]] is allowed
  * '': *'' is forbidden in reformed ''with''; we all need to review what reformed ''with'' means, as proposed
  * ''var'' and ''function'' are forbidden in ''eval'' code in strict mode. (Technically, the rule is that eval may not introduce bindings in its caller's environment in strict mode, so ''var'' and ''function'' and ''const'' and anything else introducing such bindings are forbidden at the program level, following any hoisting.  Note that this does not include "let", "let const", or "let function", as per earlier agreements on the meaning of these at the top level.)
  * Brendan proposes we need ''final'' function; Jeff counters that we spell final ''const'' - ''const function'' means write once function
  * in strict mode, function bindings have the fixed type of the original function value
    * Fixed meaning annotated, I think -- ''function f(a:int, b:string):Object{...}'' could be replaced by ''function f(a:*, b:Object):boolean{...}'' without problem.  --- //[[brendan@mozilla.org|Brendan Eich]] 2007/02/23 09:44//

===== Records =====

Concise syntax for prototype-less, immutable data structures with named properties.

===== Syntax =====

<code>
RecordLiteral ::= "#" "{" ("..." AssignmentExpression)? "}"
               |  "#" "{" PropertyDataAssignment ("," PropertyDataAssignment)* ("," "..." AssignmentExpression)? "}"

PropertyDataAssignment ::= PropertyName ":" AssignmentExpression
</code>



===== Semantics =====

  * ''typeof'' produces ''"record"''
  * enumeration always proceeds in lexicographic order of property names
  * ellipsis form provides functional update: splices in own-properties of the result if ''typeof'' result is ''"object"'', or properties if result of ''typeof'' result is ''"record"''
  * record properties are immutable
  * ''=='' and ''==='' test value equality
  * ''<'' etc. test value order/equality

We are now using an open source issue tracking tool named Trac for issues pertaining to both the specification and the reference implementation. The Trac database and interface are hosted at the following location:

The ability to create an account and file issues is open to the public. Currently, three members of TG1 have administrative access: Dave Herman, Francis Cheng, and Jeff Dyer.

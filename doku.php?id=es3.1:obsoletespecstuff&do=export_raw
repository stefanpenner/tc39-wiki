====== This material is out of date but may contain some useful material ======



This is a working draft of a proposal to define the scope and content of a maintenance revision of ES 3 (e.g. ES 3.1). Creation of this proposal was identified as an action item at the March 2007 meeting ([[meetings:minutes_mar_21_2007]]). The initial version of this proposal was authored by: Pratap Lakshman (Microsoft), Douglas Crockford (Yahoo), and Allen Wirfs-Brock (Microsoft)

Our goal for this first draft was to capture initial ES3.1 ideas so they could serve as a basis for further discussion. We realize that there are internal inconsistencies within the proposal. In fact, the initial author donâ€™t necessarily EVEN have full consensus on all the individual proposed changes. However, we do think that this can serve as a starting point for work on ES3.1.

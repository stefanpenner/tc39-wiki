===== Minutes =====
All methods in section 15 that make use of their thisValue must now account for the possibility that they are being invoked (via Function.prototype.apply or Function.prototype.call) with a non-object value passed as the thisArg - we should replace the step "let O be this object" with "let O be the result of calling ToObject on this object" - if you call/apply these methods with null or undefined this will throw in strict mode - in non-strict mode, 'this' will get bound to the global object if you do a generic invocation.

In section 4.2.2 we delete the text within the parentheses "(the Program syntactic construct …)" - move "const" back to the Future Reserved Words; add a note that alludes to the future use of 'const'  and 'let' - and, 'yield' too - remove the comments regarding the debugger keyword; now that it has been added as a statement form these comments are not required.

In section 4.3..34, change 'number' to be 'decimal value'

In section 6, delete the whole paragraph after the SourceCharacter production; it is informative text that is incomplete and potentially misleading.

In section 7.5, let ReservedWord and Identifier remain in addition to IdentifierName

Under section 8, we need to define a "Decimal Type" with language that parallels 8.5 ("The Number Type") - and call out that it admits different members of a cohort to be members of the type even though the difference is unobservable - for now, just put in a note for now that Decimal is missing - put in a note for Enviroment Records; do we want to mention Environment records in this section?

it makes more sense to have the SameValue algorithm in section 9 that deals with Type Conversion and Testing - agreed, move it to section 9.11 (currently in section 11.9.7).

in section 12 mention that it is impossible to reconcile their differing semantics of the support for FunctionDeclaration in a SubStatement, and hence ES3.1 excludes their possibility - agreed, we need to warn users away from such practice 

Need to bring back the annexes to be in sync with the rest of the document - mention strict mode (instead of usage Subset) in Annex C.

Object.prototype.isLocaleString is currently a one line description; it needs a pseudo-code based algorithm.

Ping Sam that we need Decimal updates asap - it is important that we post the "Kona" draft today.

Meeting adjourned.

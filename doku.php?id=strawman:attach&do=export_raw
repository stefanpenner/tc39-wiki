====== Proxy.startTrapping() (a.k.a. Proxy.attach) ======

Given that [[harmony:direct proxies]] are not in a position to violate any of the non-configurability or non-extensibility constraints of their wrapped target, it should be safe to replace an existing normal object by a direct proxy wrapping that object. This would enable interception of operations on //existing// objects.

We can think of ''Proxy.stopTrapping'' as taking a proxy and turning it into its target. By analogy, we propose to rename "Proxy.attach" to ''Proxy.startTrapping'', since it takes a normal object and turns it into a proxy.

Since being able to intercept all operations applied to an object is a powerful capability, an object that is actively trying to defend itself should not be replaceable by a proxy. Therefore, calling ''Proxy.startTrapping(obj)'' on an already non-extensible object ''obj'' should fail.

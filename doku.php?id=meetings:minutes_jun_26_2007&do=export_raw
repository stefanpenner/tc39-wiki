===== Notes =====

  * The [[spec:wikiexportscript|Wiki export script]] has been posted to the wiki, but our hope is that most of us will not need to use this script. Graydon is working with Dave to move the wiki from Mozilla to the es-lang.org website so that we can install a plug-in that merges the grammar and code on-the-fly. With the plug-in correctly configured, you should be able to include a tag in the wiki and have dokuwiki merge in the RI code before it displays the HTML to you.

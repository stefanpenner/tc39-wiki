====== Syntax for field names in class definitions ======

The ''Integer'' and ''String'' literals annotated with type in record fields (''ftype'' in [[proposals:syntax for type expressions]]) remind me: do we want to support arbitrary property names in class declarations:

<code javascript>
  class C {
    . . .
    public var 0 : *;
    public var "#funky" : *;
  }
</code>

Personally I'm pretty happy with the current state of affairs where only identifiers are allowed.  Allowing arbitrary names is good when you are doing hash tables (''Object'') but I'm not sure the benefit is the same in classes.

(The committee agreed offhandedly to support the syntax for octal numbers in various contexts.  This page aims to collect the details.)

Proposal retracted in favor of keeping octal relegated to a non-normative appendix, which we will clean up (http://bugs.ecmascript-lang.org/ticket/31).

====== Octal numbers ======

===== Proposal =====

E262-3 Appendices B-1.1 and B-1.2 specify the meaning of octal numbers as NumericLiteral and EscapeSequence respectively.  It is proposed that this syntax is adopted into the standard proper.

It is furthermore proposed that regular expressions incorporate this syntax where natural.  (Details TBD.)

===== Rationale =====

Allow graybeard PDP-10 programmers to keep working.

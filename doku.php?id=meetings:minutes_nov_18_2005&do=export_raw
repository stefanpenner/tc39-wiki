  * Some inconsistency about type name meaning in JScript...
  * Agree to standardize dynamic type checking, specify strict option for interop.
  * I proposed package names not trump inner-scope same names, tentative agreement that this is an AS3 bug.
  * Lexical scope lookup fixes a bug in Waldemar's drafts:
    * (Note to self: dynamic and prototype are orthogonal)

  var x = 20
  class A { function m() {print(x)} }
  class B extends A { var x = 10 }
  b = new B; b.m()                        // 10 or 20?  waldemar had 10!

  * Global this issue: is this.x === x in global code, always?  Probably yes, but allow optimization by lazy loading of builtins (AS3 has a global per script!).

  * Decimal
    * int, uint < double?
    * Reread waldemar's spec on why float <> double
    * Figure out what intermediate result types should be

  * Reread waldemar's rationale for namespace flatness instead of ordering
    * Write up a concrete versioning proposal

  * Namespace usage by pragma is block-scoped at compile time:

  if (c) {
    use namespace n1
    ...
  } else {
    use namespace n2
    ...
  }
  ...

  * So pragmas are compile-time block scoped.
  * So should import be block-scoped?  Yes.
  * Need multiple namespace attribute proposal with use-cases.
  * E4X: merge XML and XMLList

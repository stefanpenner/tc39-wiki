====== Pragmas ======

ECMAScript Edition 5 introduced a backwards-compatible syntax of the //directive prologue// with string-literal-expression-statement directives for pragmas. With Harmony, we are allowing the introduction of new syntax via [[strawman:versioning]], so we should move towards a future-proof pragma syntax.

====== Use ======

This spec proposes the introduction of a keyword ''use'' in place of the previous string-literal directives. In Harmony, the string literal form would no longer be recognized as special.

A hypothetical example is the old strawman [[strawman:lexical scope]] pragma:

<code javascript>
use lexical scope;
</code>

While this spec does not propose any //specific// pragmas, its primary purpose is to create a syntactic space for future pragmas, i.e., for future-proofing.

====== Syntax ======

The syntax of pragmas is designed to be very permissive, so that implementations may introduce custom pragmas.

<code javascript>
UsePragma  ::= "use" PragmaItem ("," PragmaItem)* ";"
PragmaItem ::= PragmaWord+
PragmaWord ::= Keyword | Identifier
</code>

====== Semantics ======

  * In Harmony, string literal statements are no longer recognized as prologue directives.

====== Open issues ======

  * semicolon insertion issues (no newline between PragmaItem keywords?)
  * more future-proofing for PragmaWord? allow literals? probably don't want to allow operators, right?
  * best practices for non-standard prefixing? (e.g., "use moz widgets")
  * A pragma that is unrecognized must be ignored? rejected?

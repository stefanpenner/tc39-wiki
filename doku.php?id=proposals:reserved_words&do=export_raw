====== Reserved words ======

(Also see the [[discussion:reserved_words|discussion page]] for this proposal)








==== Lists of reserved identifiers ====

Future reserved words are abolished. Identifiers are either completely reserved or contextually reserved. ''debugger'' and ''goto'' are made Contextually Reserved and ''enum'', ''class'', ''extends'' and ''super'' are made Reserved. ''abstract'', ''synchronized'', ''throws'', ''transient'', ''volatile'' are released back into the wild. Here's the current list. Here is an updated fragment of the syntax:

For compatibility's sake we cannot reserve for all contexts any identifier that is not already reserved by ES3 or the web. In addition to those reserved by ES3, the web reserves ''class'', ''enum'', ''extends'' and ''super'' (because IE4-7 reserve them). Here are the lexical grammars for ReservedIdentifier and ContextuallyReservedIdentifier:

<code>
ReservedIdentifier [one of]	
	break case catch class continue default delete do else enum extends false 
	finally for function if in instanceof new null return super switch this throw
	true try typeof var void while with 
	
ContextuallyReservedIdentifier [one of]	
	call cast const debugger decimal double dynamic each eval final get goto has
	implements import include int interface internal intrinsic is let namespace 
	native Number override package precision private protected prototype public 
	rounding standard strict to set static type uint undefined use xml yield
</code>

Except in the syntactic contexts specifically shown in the [[proposals::normative grammar]], the ContextuallyReservedIdentifiers can be used as user defined identifiers.


==== Unreserving identifiers after dot and in object literals ====

After ''function'', ''.'', ''..'' and ''::'', and property names in ObjectLiteral, we allow Reserved and Contextually Reserved identifiers. Here is an updated fragment of the syntax:

<code>
FieldName	
	NonAttributeQualifiedIdentifier
	String
	Number
	ReservedIdentifier
	ParenExpression
</code>

<code>
SimpleQualifiedIdentifier	
	PropertyIdentifier
	Qualifier  ::  PropertyIdentifier
	Qualifier  ::  ReservedIdentifier
	Qualifier  ::  Brackets
</code>

<code>
PropertyOperator	
	.  ReservedIdentifier
	.  QualifiedIdentifier
	..  QualifiedIdentifier
	.  ParenListExpression
	.  ParenListExpression  ::  PropertyIdentifier
	.  ParenListExpression  ::  ReservedIdentifier
	.  ParenListExpression  ::  Brackets
	Brackets
</code>

If the implementation also implements E4X, an identifier after ''@'' is contextually reserved.

**String and Array static generics**

Which ones do we want?
Refer http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=es3.1:targeted_additions_to_array_string_object_date; what about string.trim? No other browser seems to implement this natively - Need String.trim - highly desired - almost every Ajax library implements it anyway - everybody puts on the the prototype - we may want to make it a static method (similar to ES4) - lets generalize the problem - if we want to add any more of such generics where should they go? As statics? Or to the prototype? - in general we may want to add them as static methods -  - although that seems the less desirable place to put it.

whitespace definition could be an issue - keep the whitespace definition same as the one used by RegExp - none of the primordial members are "readonly" - add "trim" without the "readonly" property set - as long as frameworks can lock them down later that should be Ok.

Should we disallow transferring the 'trim' method? - perhaps it should throw an exception if its 'this' is not bound to a string - No! - it should be similar to other methods on String - it should do a ToString on the 'this' if it is not bound to a String.

**Meta**

Initial sketch of a design pattern for supporting meta operations upon objects circulated by email - mixed interest at the ES4WG meeting; conservative approach preferred.

Add new static functions as ReadOnly, DontDelete properties of Object constructor - parameterize with literal arguments enable possible analysis and static implementation of complex objects - why not introduce a new global object "Meta" and hang these static functions of that? - high cost; we have not introduced any new global names yet - note the provision to define a property as well as to define multiple properties - each such property is described using the descriptor - multiple properties are described by more than one descriptor enclosed in the [ ] - do we see the need to add any more hooks? - how about indicating constraints like non-overridable properties (i.e. a subtype cannot introduce a property with the same name) - how about 'only invokable as a function (or as a constructor)? - all, need to go through the sketch and send feedback - will be circulated over the es3.x-discuss list after this review.

**Decimal**

Decimal was discussed at the ES4 meeting - two part proposal tabled (a) mandatory library and (b) optional decimal as canonical Numeric type; library is guaranteed available for sophisticated developers, leaves room for adopting canonical decimal - (b) was strongly shot down; preference for using Number as a wrapper type and augment it with methods related to Decimal.

**Date Object**

Would like to see what are the differences from the ES4 proposal - resolve over email - circulate over es3.x-discuss

**Getters/setters**

All, need to go through the sketch and send feedback.

Meeting adjourned.

===== Discussion =====

  * ByteArray proposal (see [[proposals::bytearray]])
    * We want a small targeted class for handling blobs such as bitmaps and bytecode
    * Typed arrays are too big given no builtin character class
    * Array properties are not generally useful
  * Unicode proposal (see [[proposals:update unicode]]) -- to be finialized at next weeks f2f
  * ML reference status
    * Not a lot happening
    * Cormac asks if we are allowed to use non-standard language extensions (e.g. or patterns). it is agreed that if it makes the code clear, then it is okay but lets call out uses of such  features
    * Dave has a code generator for pretty printing
    * Graydon has implemented a lexer and ast pretty printer
    * Jeff will update the parser this afternoon
    * Cormac and Dave have made some progress on the typechecker
  * Order of class initialisation
    * Pratap asks about lazy initialising classes
    * While developing AS3 we found that the best policy for order of initialisation is the one that gives the programmer explicit control.
    * The rule is: a class is initialised when its definition is encountered at runtime
    * This avoids surprising uninitialised variable problems
    * Pratap points out that this could lead to load-time performance issues since all of the classes in a complilation unit must be compiled (jit'd) at load-time
    * This is true, but it is a cost we are willing to pay, and the user can make smaller compliation units to work around the problem
  * Meeting plans
    * We have a face-to-face at Yahoo! next week
    * Doug to send out the details

**open technical issues**

Need to get organized about how we track issues and drive them to closure - the goal of the Kona meeting is to raise and resolve all outstanding technical issues - all issues are currently part of the spec drafts as comments - prepare and send me a list of list of the issues.

**trac database**

we should use the trac database to record the issues and their resolutions - after the meeting file tickets for each issue - make sure all relevant folks have access to the database.

**SameValue algorithm**

What is the difference between the SameValue algorithm and the Strict Equality comparison algorithm? - SameValue can handle NaN comparisons; it will return true if handed two NaNs - we are using it primarily in the Array "extras"; we want to be able to look up the index within an Array where the value NaN is stored; the use of the strict equality comparison operator would not work for this case - specifically, we are using it in indexOf and lastIndexOf - in ES3 how do you check if something is a NaN? We can use isNan available from the global object.

Rather than duplicating SameValue, define it in terms of the strict equality comparison operator with an additional predicate to handle the NaN distinction

Also, as defined currently it breaks %%[[DefineOwnProperty%%]] - SameValue does not test for the exact same value; its use in %%[[DefineOwnProperty%%]] would, for e.g., let a readOnly +0 be replaced with a -0, or replace a NaN in one implementation dependent encoding with a NaN in another encoding - in the context of %%[[DefineOwnProperty%%]] we are looking for exactly the same identical value.

The SameValue name is misleading as it is really just a stricter equality test and not a identical value test - this name confusion is probably what caused it to be edited into %%[[DefineOwnProperty%%]] - consider renaming it - Ok, lets raise this on the discuss lists.

**create wiki page for the kona meeting**

not sure if John would be creating the page - lets create a wiki page for the Kona meeting, then.

Meeting adjourned.

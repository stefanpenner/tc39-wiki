Some topics that might be discussed:

  * Proposals extended or changed in significant ways
    * [[proposals:destructuring assignment|destructuring binding generalized]] (lth)
    * [[proposals:is as to|function coercion]] (lth)
    * [[proposals:extend regexps|regexp ''?I'' syntax]] (lth)
    * [[proposals:local packages|keyword for local packages]] (jd)
    * [[proposals:strict and standard modes|spelling of pragma to restrict rhs type of assignment/to]] (jd)

  * Maybe worth looking at

====== Discussion ======

  * pragma to restrict assignment in strict mode
    * group agrees that the behavior of restricting assignment is a special case that does not need a pragma
    * Jeff to revise [[proposals::strict and standard modes]] to call out the special cases for strict verification
  * destructuring changes proposed by lars look good
    * we agreed to add destructuring pattern to rest parameters as well as all other binding forms
  * clarification: functions with ...rest don't have an ''arguments'' properties in AS3
    * otherwise two arrays would be required and why would you need both (delegation maybe?)
    * not that compelling of a use case since an arguments object can be created by the delegator
  * we need a notation for the spec
    * Lars points out that the [[proposals:proper tail calls]] proposal constrains the notation
    * Jeff to drive the effort to agree on a notation
  * we agreed to change the package attribute ''private'' to ''internal'' as proposed in [[proposals:local packages]]
  * we need further review of Lars' proposals regarding [[proposals:is as to|function coercion]] and [[proposals:extend regexps|regexp ''?I'' syntax]]
  * we want to republish the public wiki on a regular basis, but need to make sure it has been cleaned up before hand. No decision

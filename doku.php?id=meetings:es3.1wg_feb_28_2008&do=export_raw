===== Minutes =====
pratapL - on treating the args array as a real array - if that were to be, than what happens if the length property were to be set to a value such that certain entries need to be thrown away (to conform to the behaviour of real Arrays?) - maybe we should withdraw that proposal

Doug - Lars wanted it to inherit the methods of the Array object

Allen - if the value you get from reading the args array is a "copy" of the params what is the problem?

pratapL - if you read args[n] into 'x' and then set the length prop such that that n'th entry were removed, your 'x' will still be what it was

Doug - what we want is to make the behaviour of the args array less surprising

Allen - it would have been if we had readonly Arrays

Doug - I can't expect anybody wanting to change the args array with the expectation of changing the actual params. That would cause confusion. Confusion is our enemy.

General discussion on nominal type systems, hard types vs soft types - Gilad Bracha's pluggable types.

General discussion of Adobe's reduced ES4 proposal, and possible implications for ES3.1

General disucssion on hard types vs soft types - Gilad Bracha's pluggable types

pratapL - what do we want to see happen by the next conf. call? Can we parallelize some of the activities?

Mark - there is value in parallelizing

Doug - lets read up on the Microsoft materials

Allen - somebody other Pratap and I need to also be updating the documents

Allen - lets discuss the deviations doc - each of you needs to come with your recommendations - go do your homeworks by next Tuesday

General agreement.

Meeting adjourned.

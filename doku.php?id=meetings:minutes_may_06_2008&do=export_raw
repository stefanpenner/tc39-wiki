**String generics**

Need to propose the string generics for both ES3.1 and ES4 - note that the form of the specification for ES4 would be different - while the form of the spec may be different, ES3.1 'content' will survive in ES4 since ES4 is upwards compat with ES3.1 - yes, we should ensure that the subset relation is maintained.

What should be treated as white space by String.prototype.trim? - actually, implementations differ in what the regexp /\s/ recognizes as white space - in this regard the behavior of IE and Safari are almost the same, and the behavior of FF and Opera are almost the same - Doug mentioned that LineSeparator and ParagraphSeparator must not be treated as LineTerminators; they are meta charactors for word processor markup - are they even used anymore? - not sure - but the definition for white space should match that used in ES3 - if IE and Safari do not match that, we can fix them as bugs - pratapL to update proposal.

Are there any other new features (in addition to string/array generics) that we want to see in ES4 too? - yes, "meta", how to indicate "strictmode" - multiple proposals for indicating strictmode in being floated around - what is permitted in strictmode may differ between ES3.1 and ES4 - the string literal expression idea can be used to indicate multiple levels of strictmode - for e.g. "strictmode1" would get you the first set of restrictions, "strictmode2" would get you the second set of restrictions, and so on - need to think about this some more.

Any progress of the opt-in versioning model? - Collin had written up some material on the wiki that covered the various ways in which script can show up in the browser (within script tags, as an event handler, in settimeout, in the url, etc.) and how in each of these cases versioning would work - need to check - perhaps the same string notation can be used as an in-file version selector.

**Getters/setters**

Allen to send feedback to Kris - lets get this on the agenda for the Thursday meeting.

Meeting adjourned.

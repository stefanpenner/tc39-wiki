===== Frequently Asked Questions =====
Please see the [[test262:faq|FAQ]] section for a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the test suite, website, test harness, etc.

===== Test Submissions =====
Test262 is being jointly developed by the members of Ecma TC39. Ecma's intellectual property policies, permit only Ecma members to directly contribute code to the project. The repository and website are managed by the [[test262:coreteam|core team]]. However, there are other ways you can help that are covered in the **Community Contributions** section below.

Ecma members should visit the [[test262:submission process|test submission process]] page for the technical requirements with respect to submitting tests.
===== Community Contributions =====
While we're only able to take back test source contributions from Ecma members, there are other ways you can help out with this conformance effort.  For one, there are literally thousands of individual test cases comprising the test262 test suite and it's unlikely that all of them are correctly implemented.  We need **your** help in:
  * carefully scrutinizing the test suite looking for cases that are validating behavior not specified in the ES5 specifications document
  * spotting assertions that are flat-out wrong with respect to ES5
  * identifying test holes 
While we'd prefer your feedback in the form of [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org|bug reports]], you're also welcome to report test262 issues directly on the [[https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/test262-discuss/|test262 mailing list]] which you can join [[https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/test262-discuss|here]].

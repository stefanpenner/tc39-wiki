===== Minutes =====
Allen - Have sent items (from the deviations doc) worthy of review to the ES3.1 WG by email

Doug - I am having second thoughts on some of the things you [Allen] and I discussed earlier - in particular about the test for unreachable code - I am having trouble formulating a rule

Adam - Of the things in the doc where IE is alone, do you have any strong feelings?

Kris - where IE is alone, it is probably a bug in IE

Kris - if IE is different, it is probably a defect in IE and we need not discuss

pratapL - not necessarily. Look at section 2.11 - that is a case where IE is alone, and all other implementations behave alike (but differently from IE), and yet that is a case where we probably want to fix the spec.

Allen - but section 2.11 is made up of two parts and the first part seems like a bug in IE

pratapL - you are right. I am specifically referring to the second part.

Allen - there are also some explicit implementation dependecies to look at. In general eliminating explicit implementation dependecies is a good thing.

Adam - there is also an issue Lars pointed out - behaviour of the scope object created for a named function expression

Allen - having that information would be handy

Adam - we should leverage Lars' paper although that list is not nearly as comprehensive

Kris - we should link into that doc too

pratapL - I can mark up the wiki with the list of deviations for ES3.1 and then you can review it offline and add comments on whether you agree/disagree

General discussion about calling another F2F meeting around the same time as the March TC39 F2F.

Meeting adjourned.

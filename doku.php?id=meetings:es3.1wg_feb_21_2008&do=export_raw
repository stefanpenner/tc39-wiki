pratapL - upcoming deadlines 22 Feb: Finalize goal statement and design principles, 14 March: Complete inventory of extensions

Allen - lets talk about the "no new syntax" principle

Mark - how about permitting syntactic changes that work across the baseline of known implementations? If 3 out of 4 implement it, then it should be a candidate for inclusion in ES3.1

Brief discussion on the value of compatibility.

pratapL - even if we don't introduce new syntax but instead enable things like 'const' which are future reserved words in ES3, we must be very careful to see how it interacts with other existing features and language rules - if not we can still cause breakage when such scripts are deployed onto earlier browser versions.

Mark - semantic features can be enabled by feature testing. New syntax should not enable semantic features - they should not enable functionality waiting on old browsers retiring. Trailing comma in object literal is a case in point

Lars - but you can make that argument about any new syntax

pratapL - tough to draw a clear line - instead lets focus on what is the consensus conformance levels that have emerged across browsers since ES3 was published - lets focus on inventorying the extensions made by IE, FireFox, Opera, Safari.

Allen - Also, you should look at the doc that we call the JScript Deviations doc - but it lists not only JScript's behaviour but also that of the other browsers.

Meeting adjourned

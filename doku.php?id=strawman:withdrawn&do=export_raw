====== Withdrawn Proposals ======

These proposals have been withdrawn by their authors or superseded by an alternative proposal that has been accepted by TC39

  * [[strawman:lexical scope]] (dherman)
  * Functions
    * [[strawman:shorter function syntax]], for defining and (or possibly only) expressing functions concisely (arv). [[harmony:arrow function syntax]] is the accepted short function proposal

  * Classes, Exemplars, Inheritance
    * [[strawman:class operator]]
    * [[strawman:classes]] (cormac)
    * [[strawman:classes as sugar]] (markm)

  * Modules - the following are alternative module proposal that were considered prior to accepting [[harmony:modules]] and related proposal
    * ([[strawman::modules harmonic]], (ihab_awad) temporary placeholder)
    * [[strawman:modules primordials]]
    * [[strawman:modules emaker style]]
    * [[strawman:modules packages]]

  * Private Name alternatives and extensions
    * [[strawman:Private Names]] with parallel scoped lexical declarations (allen)
    * [[strawman: Instance Variables]] work in conjunction with [[strawman:Private Names]] to provide strong encapsulation/information hiding.

    * Proxies: The following are all strawmen intended to patch the original [[harmony:proxies]], but are now superseded by [[harmony:direct_proxies]]:
      * [[strawman:function proxy prototype]], enabling function proxies to specify a custom prototype object (dherman)
      * [[strawman::proxy derived traps]], derived ''getPropertyDescriptor'' and ''getPropertyNames'' traps (tomvc)
      * [[strawman::handler access to proxy]], giving Proxy handlers access to the intercepted proxy (tomvc)
      * [[strawman::proxy set trap]], remove a discrepancy between the default set trap behavior of Proxies vs regular ES5 objects (tomvc)
      * [[strawman::derived traps forwarding handler]], semantics of the derived traps of the Proxy default forwarding handler (tomvc)
      * [[strawman::proxy drop receiver]], dropping the ''receiver'' parameter from ''get'' and ''set'' traps (tomvc)
      * [[strawman::fixed properties]], proxies that enforce non-configurable, non-extensible invariants (tomvc)

  * JSON
    * [[strawman:JSON path]] (crock)

  * Internationalization support
    * [[harmony:Unicode supplementary characters]] was accepted instead of these proposal
      * [[Full Unicode source code]]: Permit non-BMP characters in source code and hex escapes for non-BMP characters.
      * [[Support full Unicode in strings]]: remove all 16-bit Unicode assumptions concerning strings and source code

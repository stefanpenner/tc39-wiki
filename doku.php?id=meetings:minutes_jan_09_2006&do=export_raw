====== Agenda ======

  * Should the type Number go away? (Dick). When would I ever use the Number class? ]
    * Lars: backward compatibility is a concern. 
    * Dick: so there should be a class Number that is functionally equivalent to Double?
    * Lars: yes, that makes sense for backward compatibility.
    * Dick: so it would be a regular top-level class that inherits from Object?
    * Lars: yes.
    * Jeff: until more work is done on the ref impl, Tamarin is the definitive work on this issue.

  * Time of this meeting. Cormac has a conflict, teaching class on Tuesdays/Thursdays at 10am. Cormac isn't on the call, so we'll wait to hear from him. Current proposal is Tuesday at 8:30 or 9:00. No objections heard.

  * Graydon: working on fixtures. Class blocks: are you allowed to have pragmas in there?
    * Jeff: yes. Namespace defs at that level are statics. (ns in class blocks). In AS3 it's an error to say 'static namespace foo'.
    * G: There are two diff sets of fixtures for each instance. One for static fixtures and another for instance fixtures. I was hoping to finish last week, but got pulled away.

  * inheriting statics brought up on es4-discuss list (Brendan). 
    * Jeff: I didn't want to bring up the implementation difficulty of it.
    * Brendan: tricky that statics are in the scope chain for subclasses.
    * Jeff: we actually went pretty far down the road in implementing inherited statics in AS3, but it was very difficult to implement.
    * Lars: I don't really have an opinion. It does seem useful to have statics in the scope chain, but I don't see much use for inheriting statics.

  * Discussed automatic closing of generator-iterators -- automated only from for-in constructs on loop exit (normal or abrupt).

  * Brendan suggests ''sticky'' for the ''/y'' ''RegExp'' modifier, instead of ''anchored''.

  * Brendan suggests changing toISO to toISOString. Lars has no objections. Motion carries.

  * Pratap asked Brendan offline about Array generics. Brendan has implemented them in Array.es, and will put it in a public branch.

  * Multiple catch blocks. Javascript has multiple catch blocks using conditional statements, but they were not part of the spec. AS3 has type-constrained catch blocks, which is the direction that we'll probably want to take in the spec.

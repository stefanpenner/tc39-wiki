===== Minutes =====

  * Introductions
    * BE: Pleased to be joined by representatives of Apple and Google
    * BE: Recap of how we work
  * #112 (const)
    * LH: I have added a long comment outlining what I think are problems with the current thinking
    * WH: I don't think this is the right solution
    * BE: WH should add comments to the ticket
    * => Discuss at f2f
  * #226 (eval versioning)
    * LH: Here's the proposal...
    * WH: Keyword set or general syntax?
    * LH: Keyword set only, we should specify this.  eg string could use destructuring assignment and that would be OK, no sense in having two parsers
    * WH: Implications are unclear to me
    * => Discuss at f2f
  * #234 (byte data type)
    * BE: For newcomers: we used to have ''ByteArray'' but it didn't have much functionality.  Now we have ''Vector.<T>'', so we added ''byte'' to give it an element type to chew on, and we removed ''ByteArray''.
    * JD: What's the controversy?
    * => Cormac adds to the trac
    * => Discuss at f2f
  * #250 (typeof null)
    * BE: some code does in fact assume that ''typeof x => "object"'' means x has properties
    * BE: probably not worth it
    * JD: told you so :-)
    * => we will not change "typeof null" from ES3 -- it will still report "object"
  * #251 (typeof <something callable>)
    * BE: FF tried to say "function" for "anything callable"
    * BE: Other browsers do other things, and FF got grief
    * MS: We had similar problems in Safari
    * WH: Multiple global objects?
    * BE: ''typeof'' works globally, it does not need to worry about that
    * => Make it so
  * #241 (''in'' operator should not throw on null/undefined)
    * BE: Polishing a turd?
    * => We kill it
  * Other tickets
    * => Carried forward to next week

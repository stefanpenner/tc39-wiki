===== Public Minutes =====

  * Open issues
    * #276 (this propagation)
      * WH: I think this will make the language worse, since calling through a "var" has different meaning than calling directly
      * BE: But the language already makes distinctions based on the call expression, and on the object in which the function is bound
      * AWB: What are the compatibility issues?  Are there analyses of what might break?
      * => Action item: LH to try to refocus around what's good for methods and whether that lends any insight
    * #7 (type of C.prototype)
      * No real debate about the static type of C.prototype, it is "Object"
      * Classes have prototype properties for the DOM and there's precedent for prototypes, so the model in ES4 (classes have "prototype" properties) is in general not open to debate
      * WH: if the prototype is an instance of a class, is it a singleton, what happens if it's instantiated again?
      * ...
      * => LH to try to summarize and move forward
      * JD: Let's try to use email to see how it goes
      * BE: Use es4-discuss.
    * Other items
      * Deferred until next time

===== Minutes =====
**JSON Notation changes**

Need to change the JSON notation to conform with the rest of the ES3.1 - can use the enhanced notation called out in section 5.2

**Decimal**

Sam to use the same convention as used by JSON - tried out a brief edit in the latest draft of the spec (just to get familiar with Word) - pratapL to integrate and send it back to Sam.

**Getters/Setters surface syntax**

Don’t anticipate too many changes from the proposal circulated earlier - need to update to use the new statics on Object - need to update and circulate the proposal.

**Object statics**

Need to specify the statics on object - will get it this week.

**Unicode**

Unicode versions are backwards compat - Java, C#, WinXP, Win2K3 support Unicode 4.0, and Vista supports 5.0 - may not be a problem to say support version 'x' as of when the language was designed - lets ask MarkM if we can get help from the Google representative on Unicode issues - also, send email on the discuss lists asking for volunteers.

**Static Generics on Array**

Allow a shorter form for calling Array generics - useful for Array-like elements; for e.g. calling Array methods on Array-like DOM elements like NodeList - but the number of cases where we can avoid the longer form of calling the generics is not large enough to justify inclusion in the language - ok, lets send email on the discuss list about this.

**Feedback on 11 June draft**

Lars has sent some comments last night - not all in today's meeting have seen it yet though - some incompatibilities between ES3.1 and ES4 have been pointed out - should we get rid of enhanced notation? - no, the notation extensions are required for some of the more complex algorithms; lets keep them - in that case should we change all of the notation to conform to these extensions? - no! I would like to retain as much of the original spec as possible - as an implementer we have references to specific section in the spec, and to specific line numbers for some algorithms and I would prefer if that does not get invalidated - also, that the Es3.1 strict mode was not aligned with the proposed-ES4 strict mode - need to understand that more; any ES3.1 program should be a valid proposed-ES4 program too - 

pratapL has put up a list of TBDs on the wiki; lets put some names against each item:

Update Array generics to be as implemented by Mozilla - pratapL

Add support for reduce and reduceRight (from JS 1.8) - pratapL

Introduce support for “abc”[i] (3 out of 4 browsers support this notation to index into a string) - pratapL

Update the Date section to be compatible with proposed-ES4 - pratapL

JSON - Doug

Decimal - Sam

Getters/Setters (introducing syntactic sections that add them to object literals) - Kris

... and specify related static methods on Object - Allenwb

Unicode related updates - no owner (ask Mark, and on the list)

Modify the internal property “Put” on Arrays to account for strict mode - pratapL

Update notation used (as appropriate) - Allenwb + everyone whose hasn’t used it

Cleanup and update Appendixes and Annexes - pratapL

Ensure Review based on the Deviations doc - Adam

Can we get updates on JSON, Getters/Setters, and the Object methods by coming Tuesday? - lets aim for it.

Meeting adjourned.

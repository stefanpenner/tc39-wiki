===== Minutes =====

  * Wiki
    * BE: ECMA just wants access; just open it up
    * JD: seconded
    * JD: some obsoleted content (off the main page) should be closed off; need a staging space for meeting notices
    * BE: doesn't really matter too much with the minutes etc
    * JD: I will sync with DH
    * BE: I will send out another note to give people another chance.  Nobody has voiced concerns yet.
  * #153
    * We accept this with "meta::static: Function", and we call it "Callable"
    * => LH to update when the Trac server is no longer dying
  * #112
    * Write-once is simplest
    * Burden on implementation unclear, not obviously worse than general nullability though (which requires a read barrier)
    * Should "const" hoist?
    * JD: const will be slower than var...
    * LH: could require like nullability -- initializer required or else initializer in settings, otherwise error.
    * BE: if it's not in the settings then it's analysis...
    * LH: for locals it's easy
    * JD: for statics and globals it's a read barrier
    * LH: or ReadOnly if there's an initializer, this is cheaper
    * BE: I'm convinced there's a barrier anyhow
    * LH: All the RegExp classes get by with just using the settings
    * => still mulling this over, see the Trac ticket for details.
  * #235
    * Discussion.
    * => look into it more next week.

(Wiki barfage prevented much more progress.  Jeff and Dave investigating.)

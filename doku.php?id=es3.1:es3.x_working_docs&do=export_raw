=== Microsoft's "JScript Deviations" document ===
This documents known deviations, implementation defined behaviors, and extensions of Internet Explore's JScript implementation relative to 262-3. It also attempts to identify common interpretations and variations among widely used ES3 implementations. This document is a draft of ongoing work.

I've taken the liberty to annotate two of these working documents (using the "Sticky notes" in Acrobat; I believe they are visible if the documents are viewed with Adobe Reader, but do let me know if that turns out not to be the case), pointing out where the proposals coincide with ES4 and critiquing some of the concrete proposals in other cases.

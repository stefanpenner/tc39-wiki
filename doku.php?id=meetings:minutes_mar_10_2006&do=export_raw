===== Notes =====

  * Lars added some notes and topics for discussion in several proposals, including [[proposals:strict and standard modes]] and [[clarification:compact profile]]. One concern to keep in mind is that some proposals may affect the feasibility of other proposals. For example, implementing [[proposals:type inference]] may make other proposals more difficult to implement.
  * Main topic I heard was how static dialect needs traits, or something like them, in order to allow this-unqualified name lookups in methods, which may  end up binding to global or outer-scope slots. Jeff will append a write-up of the issue to the [[clarification:drop traits]] page.
  * Brendan has conflicts, sorry.
  * Adjourned early, will wiki hard and take things up at the face to face next week.
  * Two-day meeting next week at Adobe's San Francisco office. Start at noon on Thursday, March 16. Adobe will host dinner on Thursday night. Start again at 10am on Friday, March 17.
  * [After the meeting adjourned] Brendan withdraws [[proposals:group assignment]] in favor of [[proposals:destructuring assignment]].

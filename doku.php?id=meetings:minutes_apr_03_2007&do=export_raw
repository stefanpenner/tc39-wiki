==== Refimpl ====

  * Graydon has the engine booting from the builtins written in ES4
    * Previously, it was using hard coded ML for core functionality
  * Goal for this week is to get the Spidermonkey test harness (''tests/spidermonkey/ecma/shell.js'') running
  * Chris asks, what can he do?
    * We'll try to keep a list of todos for people to pick up as they have time available
    * Once the core ES3 functionality is working, we can all focus on the proposals

There are various issues that need to be identified and researched concerning how the ES3.1 specification will relate to the ES4 specification.  A quick list of possible alternatives includes:
  * ES4 adopts a new name (ECMAScript++, ECMAScript II, etc.) and its specification is issued as revision 1 using a new ECMA standard number, ES3.1 spec is published as revision 4 of 262.
  * ES4 and ES3.1 are published as separate revisions of 262, but both revisions remain as active ECMA publications. (See for example, ECMA-363)
  * ES4 and ES3.1 are co-published as a two volume 262 specification and sharing the same revision number. (See for example, ECMA-376)
  * ES4 and ES3.1 are published as a single volume document, internally organized into two distinct parts.

<strong>ES3.1 strict mode</strong>
</p>

<p>
We want that writing to a &ldquo;readonly&rdquo; property should throw an exception; does that not change control flow in a manner that could catch developers/testers off guard especially if it happens to be in some rarely traversed code path? - that is actually good to have from a integrity perspective - don&rsquo;t want execution to continue in the normal code path once such integrity is compromised - it changes control flow in a fail-stop manner - Strict mode defines a fail-stop subset of the language (just like in the case of Caja/JavaScript) - strict mode comes into effect on a per-module basis - but isn&rsquo;t throwing an exception a global characteristic? - need to worry about the case where writes happen across module boundaries; should we honour the mode of the source, or of the destination? - also, there is no notion of objects being defined on a per module basis; how would we define that? - need the concept of a function defined in a module - since functions are defined by special forms using the &lsquo;function&rsquo; keyword, they are unambiguous: a function defined in a strict module is strict. Objects don&rsquo;t need to be strict or not. Only operations on objects do. The property assignments 
</p>
<pre class="code">  x.foo = y</pre>

<p>
and
</p>
<pre class="code">  x[f] = y</pre>

<p>
 are strict or not, and therefore throw or not, depending on the strictness of the module this assignment appears in. So this case follows the &ldquo;honour source&rdquo; rule.
</p>

<p>
How do we indicate &lsquo;strict mode&rsquo;? - multiple proposals being floated - there is the &ldquo;use&rdquo; &ldquo;strict&rdquo;, and the one armed if statement: &ldquo;if&rdquo; &ldquo;(&rdquo; &ldquo;false&rdquo; &ldquo;)&rdquo; &ldquo;use&rdquo; &ldquo;(&rdquo; &ldquo;strict&rdquo; &ldquo;)&rdquo; - how about using the meta statement; something like //@strictMode - a hint within a comment - kind-of like embedding javadoc comments within source code - but javadoc can be stripped out of source without changing the semantics - meta statements (within comments) won&rsquo;t be handled well by minifiers - wait! Stop thinking about them as comments - minifiers anyway need to handle the conditional compilation syntax in <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> - the one armed if statement is weird - and the &ldquo;use&rdquo; &ldquo;strict&rdquo; is like two statements that need to be present as if in a prologue position; and that is very unintuitive - how about indicating it with a do-nothing string literal expression-statement? - how about indicating it as an attribute on the script tag? - Ian Hickson and <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> folks feel that such conditioning should be done within the material that is being loaded rather than on the page that is loading the material - ok, that might aid code reuse too - need to raise all proposals - or, we need to look at strict mode differently.
</p>

<p>
ES4 strict mode is strict about arity too - not possible to enforce that in ES3 - Mark to work on a proposal (leaving aside the issue of how one turns on strict mode)

<p>
How about having a &ldquo;redefinable&rdquo; attribute instead of a &ldquo;deletable&rdquo; attribute? - if &ldquo;redefinable&rdquo; is set, then you can define a property and later change its attributes (so long as it&rsquo;s redefinable, one can also delete it); if it is not set, then you can do neither - is &ldquo;readonly&rdquo; but &ldquo;deletable&rdquo; even useful? - no need to factor that out; it is a harmless orthogonality - UNIX File system as an example - can own a file but can make it readonly - agreed that this was weak, how about folding together writable and redefinable into one bit. No one would mourn the loss of readonly-but-deletable. However, we also need to express writable-but-not-deletable, so we still need two bits.
</p>

<p>
What does &ldquo;readonly&rdquo; mean in the presence of getters and setters? - does it mean the definition cannot be changed? - whether getters and setters can be replaced must be determined by &ldquo;redefinable&rdquo; - property is either a data property (value + writable) or a procedural property (getter + setter functions) - &ldquo;(getter + optional setter)&rdquo;. If a procedural property has no setter attribute, then it is considered readonly - a property intended to a purely a method must also not be &ldquo;writable&rdquo; - that seems like a fuzzy difference - we store functions as data values - defining &ldquo;readonly&rdquo; (const) properties could be common - what else can we make the distinction pay for? - Caja makes strong distinction between simple functions, methods, and constructors - need a more detailed proposal with pros and cons - we should postpone making such distinction until ES3.2.
</p>

<p>
Can we introduce new attributes in ES3.1 (from the perspective of &ldquo;redefinable&rdquo;, etc.) - if we can do any, we can do multiple - must pay for themselves, though - may have impact on the low level object representation - what if some implementation has only 1 bit left? - nobody has asked if new attributes are tolerable to existing implementations, and if so, is there a limit to that tolerance - need a list of candidate attributes for future versions of the spec - how about &ldquo;protected&rdquo; for ES3.2?
</p>

<p>
1 arg beget or 2 arg beget? - can tolerate either, but definitely need the first arg - lets think about this some more.
</p>

<strong>Getters/setters (from last call)</strong>

It is not clear what the dispatch rules are (to me). It would be good to add specific language stating:

  * Which sort of overriding is allowed.
  * Whether the static (variable) or dynamic (object) type is used for method dispatch.
  * Whether any specialization on argument types or return type might influence that.
  * Which rules are used for dispatching n-ary operators.

I suspect the rules are similar to "java with no overloading", but I'm not sure.

Some discussion of the way AS works is in the minutes [[meetings:minutes_feb_03_2006|here]].

I'm satisfied with my understanding of the dispatch rules now. There is no dispatch based on argument type, there is no dispatch to static methods based on object type, except for operators. There is no overloading, over single-name overriding.

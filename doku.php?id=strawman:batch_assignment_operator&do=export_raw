====== Rationale ======

A convenient syntax for copying multiple own-properties from one object into another. This exists in current frameworks (up to minor differences) as an ''extend'' method.

====== Examples ======

<code javascript>
x .= { foo: 1, bar: "bar", baz: true };

obj1 .= obj2;
</code>

===== Discussion ======

One nice thing with the ''.{'' operator was that it allowed chaining.

<code javascript>
let element = document.querySelector('...');
element.{
  textContent: 'Hello world'
}.{
  style.{
    color: 'red',
    backgroundColor: 'pink'
  }
}.{  // back on element
  onclick: alert
};
</code>

The above could have been written with less curly braces but the above illustrates the point better.

The above allows jQuery style chaining without a custom API.

The op= forms don't allow this.

For hotels, Opera has a list [[http://www.opera.com/company/visitors|here]].

I believe some have enjoyed staying at the [[http://www.thonhotels.com/opera|Thon Hotel Opera]] (that is as in "the opera", not "Opera Software" :)

The [[http://www.radissonsas.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=RadissonSAS/integration/hotelInfo&hotelCode=oslzh|Radisson SAS Plaza Hotel]] (next to the Thon Hotel Opera) was very popular
last year because it's pleasant (after the first 200m or so) to walk
from it along the river up to Opera.

The easiest way into town (though maybe not the fastest) is to take the SAS Flybussen (Airport Bus) to the [[http://www.scandinavia.oslo.radissonsas.com/|Radisson SAS Scandinavia Hotel]] (which is the bus's last stop, and is **not** the same as the Radisson SAS Plaza).  If your goal is to carry your bags as little as possible, this is the way to go.

The fastest way to get to downtown (which may or may not be the fastest way to get to your hotel, mind you) is to take the Flytoget (airport express train) to Oslo S (Oslo central train station).  From there, it’s bus, T-bane (subway – look for the big T), trikk (light rail), osloferjene (Oslo ferry), or taxi to wherever you’re staying. For all but the taxis, check out [[http://trafikanten.no/|Trafikanten]]. (Click the UK flag for Norwenglish.)

Useful words when trying to navigate trafikanten:
  * kart = map
  * tog = train
  * Jernbanetorget (foran Oslo S) = the main public transportation hub (right in front of Oslo S)

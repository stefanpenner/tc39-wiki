====== JSON.path ======

JSONpath is an XPath-like language for extracting information from data structures. See [[http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/]] and [[http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/]].

It is proposed that a ''path'' property be added to the ''JSON'' object, whose value is a function that takes an object or array, and a JSONpath string, and returns a value.

===== Notes =====

**Solution 9 and friends**

      * We agreed with Lars' summary (sent to tg1 reflector) to be posted as a proposal
      * Seems we agreed to consider removing ''meta static function convert'' and operator ''to'' in favor of ''meta static function invoke'' and invocation of the class as a function (without ''new''). Right?  --- //[[brendan@mozilla.org|Brendan Eich]] 2007/07/31 18:11//

**(low pri) Array proposal, seriously scaled down**

      * Lars has redone [[proposals:arrays]]. It's not much more than what is already agreed on. Check it out.

**Decimal issues on [[discussion:decimal]]**

      * #4 - Dick to do compatibility testing to resolve
      * #6 - Dick to log a trac ticket to capture issue

====== Discussion ======

  * Doug to propose triple-quoting, both for multiline strings that can include " and ', and for doc comment meta-data.

  * Lars points out that the iterator type is a recursive structural type -- Brendan promises fixed and more complete proposal next week.

  * Can we drop ''cast'' in favor of ''to''?  Resolution: no, want both: "is cast to" ;-).

  * Cormac raises the conversion to union type question: which type?  First in left-to-right order that can convert?
    * Graydon: perhaps require exactly one type in union convert to convert implicitly, otherwise you have to disambiguate.
    * Michael: be explicit always?
    * Graydon: isn't the use-case one where the converting code does not know it has a union target in hand?
    * Cormac: odd if a function taking double is passed ''int'', then grows to take a union ''(Boolean, double)'' and the call breaks.
    * Graydon: then back to pick first in left-to-right order that has conversion.
    * Brendan: why not always require first to have a conversion, for implicit conversion to work?
    * Graydon: so in evolving an interface using a union type, always add at the end.
    * Lars: union (decimal, ...) and you add double -- ambiguity if the first type with a conversion rule is used.
    * People want to think about "implicit conversion uses left-most type" rule.

  * Conversion to boolean, [[spec:type_system]] under "Type Checking": since all built-in types convert to ''Boolean'', why not have the type system model things that way?  Ok.

  * Lars: meeting agenda for September face-to-face at Mozilla should be constructed in advance.

  * Jeff: make Oct. 1 the deadline for what's in the spec, so what is "in" should be first agenda item for Sept. meeting.

  * Michael to wiki issues/bugs he's found in grammar.

  * Pratap: re-export wiki?  Brendan: could be helpful to get more eyes on proposals.  Jeff: let's talk about it next week.  Brendan: can we highlight changes from the last export?  Graydon: maybe.

  * Brendan: let's follow up on es4-discuss re: nullability by default, no call/cc or coroutines, other dangling threads.

  * Lars: proposal walk-through in Oslo left a bunch of items "open" -- we need to go through those next week too.

**Discussing the edits**

Switching to strict mode; need to close on how to indicate that - Allen's suggestion seems to be winning - use a do-nothing string literal "use strict" - is there a way to introspect that? - what about other ways in which script could sneak in to a browser? - each of those cases are by default not strict; if they begin with "use strict" they go in to strict mode - strict mode is per script, not per frame - what about eval code? - same applies to the global eval function - for the eval operator strictness is inherited from its context - need to review how one distinguishes these in ES3.1 - some open design issues here.

**String.prototype.quote**

What about string.quote? - JSON2 has a quote method - why not just drop it and use the one defined by JSON2? - that would be awkward - agreed - string.quote in FireFox does something different though - in this particular case, reluctant to specify a string.quote that is incompatible with FireFox - ok, just drop it.

**"abc"[0]**

"abc"[0] is supported in 3 out of 4 browsers and by ES4 - is it merely a syntactic convenience? - programmers coming from other languages expect it to work - non-surprising features; indeed, it would be surprising if it did not work - it is just syntactic sugar for charAt (when the argument is a String and the property being looked up is a number - agree that that is how it should be specified - no unanimous agreement on whether we want to propose it though.

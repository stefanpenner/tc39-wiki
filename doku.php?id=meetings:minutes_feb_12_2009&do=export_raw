**On the %%[[Class%%]] internal property**

Should restrict values that host objects can use for their %%[[Class%%]] property - for every value of the %%[[Class%%]] property we should call out the contract that needs to be supported by the object - %%[[Class%%]] needs to be treated as an unforgeable nominal type for the internal type system; we should call out what specific internal methods need to be supported - that would be clarifying - should not have to repeat/rehash any of the prose that is already in the specification though - agreed, especially because some of the JavaScript objects have %%[[Class%%]] values that do not adhere to this metaphor of nominal types; for e.g. Math objects have %%[[Class%%]] set to "Math", and JSON objects have their %%[[Class%%]] set to "JSON", and yet there is no difference in the internal methods they support - we deliberately chose to name it as "JSON" using Math as the model - perhaps we could have avoided that - anyway, lets explicitly call out what specific values a host object may not set for its %%[[Class%%]] internal property.

**JSON resolution regarding arguments**

No change - JSON will serialize it as an object.

**Strict mode implementation status**

I’ve implemented the revised behaviour for ‘arguments’; joining to the formal parameters is severed, and access to the caller and callee properties throws an exception.

**Telnet access**

Any update on providing telnet access for playing around with the JScript implementation? - No, not yet.

Meeting adjourned.

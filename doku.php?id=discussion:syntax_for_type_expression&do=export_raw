===== Questions/Comments =====

  * Remind me, or point me to where it says, what the meaning of brockets is in a type expression. Answering my own question: Brockets are one of the proposed notations for parameterized types [[type_parameters]].

  * Of all the bracketing options in the [[type_parameters]] proposal, I prefer ''T%%[%%[U]]'' for ease of typing and ease of reading. That said, in ES3 ''T%%[%%[U]]'' evaluates to the property of ''T'' whose name matches the string value of ''U''. It may be uncommon enough that we can take it to mean the type T parameterized by U, but we should check.

Unless ''U'' is ''null'' or ''undefined'', in which case ''Array.prototype.toString'' applied to ''%%[U]%%'' returns the empty string!

We can try spidering for ''%%[[%%'' on the web.  If we find hits, it should give us pause.  If we don't, we may still feel nervous about this incompatibility.  Something like ''%%[|...|]%%'' is safer, but as noted in [[type parameters]] and reaffirmed by your comment, it sure is hard to type.

Is this up to date? I thought we were converging on the ''%%T.<U>%%'' syntax...?

Correct, the above commentary is out of date. We have converged on ''%%T.<U>%%'', see the comments around May 16 on [[discussion:type_parameters]].

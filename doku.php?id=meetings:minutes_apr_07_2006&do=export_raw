===== Notes =====

=== Maude vs. Stratego ===

  * Dave found Maude harder to extend syntactically
  * Graydon: Maude uses operator precedence for parsing the model
  * Dave heard Maude's type system is hard to work with
  * Might be able to port models


=== Recent changes ===

  * Lars: destructuring assignment and block expression cleanups
  * Lars: function type syntax proposal
    * Dave: don't forget optional ''this'' type annotation (''this:T'')
  * Graydon: drop traits commentary
    * Brendan: let's not abuse "traits"
  * Lars: type system notes, including nullability via sum
    * Dave: not quite sum if syntax not restricted
    * Do we allow ''?T!'', or only ''?T'' and ''T!'' where ''T'' may be ''U!'' or ''?U''
    * Need to flatten given lack of distributivity in the proposal
  * Lars: type parameterization like C++ templates
    * Graydon: but without code bloat, generally speaking
    * Lars: except for int vs. uint
    * Brendan: int/uint <: Number?  No, <: Object in current spec -- seems like a bug
  * Graydon: re: int/uint <: Number,
    * decimal128 does not have enough digits to represent every IEEE double
    * decimal128 is 34 decimal digits + scaling digits
    * We could use decimal256 or similar
    * Graydon: mode flags not being standardized one way, so users must choose
      * does mode have static (source) or dynamic (caller) "scope"?
      * rounding for different locales and tax vs. non-tax finance contentions
    * Brendan/Jeff: supporting decimal only via m suffix is controversial as mfc said
    * We still believe we need a pragma to allow implicit use of decimals, not doubles
      * This leads to questions about pragmas...
  * Lars: ''use namespace N'' and other pragmas come first, but that means ''namespace N'' comes after at top-level
    * Brendan: forward reference should work, if '''namespace N'' hoists a la ''function F''
    * resolved: open a block if you want to use after defining
  * Lars has AST interfaces, see http://people.opera.com/lth/tc39-tg1/index.html
  * Pragma proposal should be usable (no pun): ''use strict, decimal'' or shorter, or people will hate us
  * Jeff: working on namespaces, note that packages map to namespaces pretty directly, will write up


=== Schedule ===

  * June publication
  * How to expose?  Readonly access to wiki
    * Jeff: talk pages?  Graydon: do-able
  * Update spec as we go?
    * Need notation
    * Need to target final format
      * Can we translate from wiki to PDF?  Lars: go via XML and format to PDF with PrinceXML, it gives us both PDF and something web-readable.  Notes about early experiments with this route may be found under [[spec:extraction and formatting]]

=== Type parameters ===

  * Brendan: favor ''<>'' over ''()'' because ''<>'' implies '': const type'' on each type param
  * Lars: stronger argument, ''Array(V)'' means what?  want backward compat, so need ''<>'' for type param

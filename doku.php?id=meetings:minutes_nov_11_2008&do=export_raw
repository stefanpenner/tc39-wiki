What should we do regarding Statement and SubStatement? - what is in Statement that is not there in SubStatement? VariableStatement - FunctionDeclaration is in neither.

In ES3 we have a single grammar production Statement that specifies what can occur in nested statement contexts such as in "then" and "else" clauses of an if statement - ES3.1 drafts have split that into separate Statement and SubStatement productions - SubStatement excludes VariableStatement and FunctionDeclaration (and ConstantStatement, while we had them) and is used in most nested contexts - in the revised grammar, nested Statement productions only occur as the body of blocks and as function bodies - this is to support blocks introducing nested lexical declaration environments - should nested declarations without the brace brackets (nested naked blocks) be considered to be an implicit lexical block? - they should be useless or illegal - prefer it to be illegal - and the introduction of SubStatement enables it to be flagged as illegal - from a hygiene perspective too we don't want VariableStatement in nested blocks.

But, such exclusion of VariableStatement from SubStatement is a breaking change - perhaps we should just leave this one alone for ES3.1 - migration tax argument from Brendan - can we introduce the restriction only in strict mode? 

What about VariableStatement appearing as a Statement of a LabelledStatement? - that seems a secondary issue -  in ES3 any statement can have a label including function declarations - indeed, and ES3 programs have been known to use labels as annotations! 

How about the following:

  * Remove any distinction between Statement and SubStatement
  * in non strict mode - VariableStatement can appear anywhere
  * in strict mode - VariableStatement is prohibited in nested blocks and nested naked blocks
  * no restriction on VariableStatement occurring as a Statement of a LabelledStatement

Ok, lets float this on the discuss lists.

Meeting adjourned.

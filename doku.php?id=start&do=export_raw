====== About this wiki ======

This is a wiki for the ongoing specification work of Ecma [[http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm|TC39]], the technical committee tasked with standardization of the ECMAScript programming language. Most of the wiki is world-readable, meaning that anyone can view the pages. Certain sections are restricted to members of the  technical committee.

The wiki is running on [[http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki|DokuWiki]], a wiki program for editing documentation. It has several [[http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:features|features]] which are helpful for that task. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the mechanisms of the wiki.

Please see [[wiki/syntax]] for a description of the wiki's markup language. It is very lightweight, similar to plaintext.
























====== ECMAScript 5th Edition ======
The ECMAScript 5th Edition specification was approved as an Ecma Standard in December 2009.  ECMAScript 5.1, approved in June 2011, is a maintenance revision of the ECMAScript 5 specification.  ECMAScript 5.1 corrects technical and editorial errors in the 5th Edition. The content of Edition 5.1 is identical to the  ISO edition of the ES5 specification. The ECMAScript 5.1 specification can be accessed here:\\

Issues related to the ES5 specification can be discussed on the ES5-discuss mailing list or reported with the bug tracking system.\\

====== Subdirectories of the wiki ======

DokuWiki permits organization of pages into subdirectories (or "namespaces"). I have added a few namespaces to help organize our work. Anyone can add new namespaces, just like anyone can add new pages, but it helps if we keep the number few so that we can find one another's work.

Active work related to future ECMAScript revision - code named [[harmony:harmony|Harmony]]:
  * [[strawman:strawman|The 'strawman' namespace]] is intended to hold Harmony proposals prior to approval.
  * [[harmony:harmony|The 'harmony' namespace]] is intended to hold tentatively approved [[harmony:proposals]] for the "ES-Harmony" language.
  * Working drafts of the specification for the next edition of ECMAScript that incorporates Harmony proposals is on the [[harmony:Specification Drafts]] page.
  * [[meetings:meetings|The 'meetings:' namespace]] Notes, presentations, etc. from TC39 meetings.



Other current subdirectories:
  * [[test262:test262|The 'test262' namespace]] is intended to hold information pertinent to the design, development, and execution of test262 tests.
  * [[resources:resources|The 'resources:' namespace]] is for uploading papers or listing pointers to external sites of interest to the work of this group.
  * [[ses:ses|The 'ses:' namespace]] is for the Secure ECMAScript work.
  * [[conventions:conventions|The 'conventions:' namespace]] is for patterns and snippets of code offered as an agreed compromise to unify existing diverse practices.
  * [[globalization:globalization|The 'globalization:' namespace]] is for work on the Globalization API specification.

Known obsolete:

  * [[es3.1:es3.1|The 'es3.1:' namespace]] was for the "maintenance of es3" work, which became [[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/drafts/tc39-2009-025.pdf|ES5]].
  * [[features specs:feature specs|The 'feature specs:' namespace]] is intended to hold detailed feature definitions.
  * [[proposals:proposals|The 'proposals:' namespace]] is intended for informal discussion of proposed changes.
  * [[discussion:discussions|The 'discussion:' namespace]] is intended for permanent archival of discussion.
  * [[clarification:clarifications|The 'clarification:' namespace]] is intended to capture high-level issues that need clarification.
  * [[bugs:bugs|The 'bugs:' namespace]] is for tracking the status of bugs in the spec document
  * [[ri:ri|The 'ri:' namespace]] is for information about the reference implementation that's not in the mtn
  * [[spec:spec|The 'spec:' namespace]] is intended to hold actual proposed and agreed-to chapter text for the final ES4 spec document

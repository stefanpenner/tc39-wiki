====== Clarification issues ======

These are items that we hope to clarify, not necessarily //change//. The existing language in the spec is considered incomplete or unclear, or a committee member is worried about something not making sense.


===== Syntactic issues =====

  * [[abstract syntax tree]], what is an AST for the language.
  * [[syntax for field names in classes]], what is it? idea withdrawn

===== Scope, binding and dispatch issues =====

  * [[lexical scope]], sundry notes about the benefits of lexical scoping over dynamic scoping and how we might either migrate the language toward lexical scoping or provide features that discourage the use of dynamic scoping.
  * [[scopes for directives and definitions]], what is the visibility of definitions and directives? (see [[proposals::normative grammar]])
  * [[dispatch rules]], a request to clarify the rules on method and operator dispatch. 
  * [[package semantics]], notes on what packages mean
  * [[which prototype?]], the question of whether to create objects "as if by the expression new Foo" or "using the original Foo.prototype value"
  * [[multiple compilation units]], sharing external definitions


===== Type issues =====

  * [[type system]], notes on the type system and a great deal of discussion
  * [[formal type system]], attempts at formalizing the type system
  * [[type hierarchy for numbers]], an attempt at clarification
  * [[drop traits]], (resolution, we keep traits but give them a new name, **fixtures**). This has been downgraded from a proposal to a clarification issue. The original proposal was written as graydon's post http://venge.net/graydon/proposed-es4-changes.txt.
  * [[runtime types and conversions]], discussion of the dynamic portion of the type system.

===== Other issues =====

  * [[code mixing]], a request to clarify the interactions between "new" and "old" code. 
  * [[compact profile]], various thoughts on how to design the language so as to allow it to work well on small systems.

===== Compatibility issues =====

  * [[Adobe AS3]], list the ways ES4 will break existing AS3 programs

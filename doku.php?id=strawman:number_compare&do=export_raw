====== Number.prototype.compare ======

It is proposed that a ''compare'' function be added to ''Number.prototype''. It can take three arguments. The first two arguments are number values to be compared. The third argument is the ''tolerance''. If the third argument is falsy, then 0 is assumed.

It could be implemented like this:

    Number.prototype.compare = function (first, second, tolerance) {
        var difference = first - second;
        return Math.abs(difference) <= (tolerance || 0) ? 0 : difference < 0 ? -1 : 1;
    };

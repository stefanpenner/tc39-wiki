Should we make ''intrinsic'' a keyword, or a const definition that can be shadowed. The current spec says that ''public'', ''private'', ''protected'' and ''internal'' are keywords and cannot be used as identifiers. They could be made to be const globals too, but then the meaning of ''public::x'', for example, might depend on compile time or even run time context. This makes some programs harder to read. We could use the same argument for (or against) making ''instrinsic'' a keyword. I say whatever we decide for ''public'' we do for ''intrinsic''.

Practically speaking, the costs and benefits of supporting shadowing (that is, of using a global const rather than a reserved identifier) are likely to be a wash.  What makes for incompatibility is the preemption of a global const or a reserved identifier.  So I am ok with reserving.  The proposal not to reserve identifiers in "property name" contexts needs to be formalized, and we need to spider the web a bit.

  * Lars
  * Francis
  * Doug
  * Jeff
  * Dave
  * Brendan

===== Agenda =====

  * The nature of the type hierarchies under Number, String, and Boolean
    * See [[clarification:type hierarchy for numbers|Type hierarchies for builtins]] for a writeup of the issues
    * Related tickets
      * [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/3|#3]]: ''int'', ''uint'', ''double'', and ''decimal'' are not subtypes of ''Number'', but peers of it
      * [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/123|#123]]: Can/should ''Number'' be mutable and/or re-bindable?  How do we express this?
  * Open tickets
    * [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/168|#168]]: Should the new builtin types have prototype/intrinsic method pairs, or just public methods on instances
    * [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/149|#149]]: A namespace %%__ES4__%% that is opened when eg the mime type selects version 4 or higher, with a growth path for %%__ES5__%% and so on (please read the discussion in the ticket)
    * (do add your own)
  * Proposals
    * The [[proposals:bound this]] proposal, which should help us to defer [[proposals:self type]].
    * Final review of proposals
      * We start with "type parameters" and go down the list
  * Sundry


===== Reminder =====

  * Next week we meet at Mozilla on September 27 and 28.  That meeting is tentatively the hard deadline for all proposals to be in good shape, or else face the risk of being deferred until ES5.


===== Minutes =====

Type hierarchy

  * We agree that the "flat view" is OK
  * Some open questions about how to do the snapping of the prototype
  * Brendan OK with "Strings, Booleans" as type names

Intrinsic/prototype

  * Agree that for compatibility it's necessary to have both

The %%__ES4__%% namespace

  * Sounds plausible, let's try it and see how it goes

Bound this

  * Looks like "this:bound" is the winning syntax proposal, after much discussion
  * Proposal needs a little work before we decide what to do about it

Next f2f

  * Add yourself to the meeting page, send a note to Brendan if you're going to the meeting but not to dinner

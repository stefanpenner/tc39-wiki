Whenever any function is invoked in the function form, ''this'' will now be bound to ''undefined'', not to the Global object. This is not the ideal behavior, but is significantly less unsafe than the current behavior.

Whenever a function is invoked by ''apply'' or ''call'', ''this'' will be bound to the //thisValue// and not the Global object.

As written, the preceding proposal is not compatible with the current proposed behavior for ES4.  In fairness, that proposal is still being discussed.

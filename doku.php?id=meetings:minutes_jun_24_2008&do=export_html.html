<p>
Would like to add a couple more items to agenda that we can get to if we have the time (1) inconsistence language like &ldquo;as if by the expression …&rdquo; pervasive in ES3 (e.g. section 11.1.4 Array Initializer: &ldquo;create a new array as if by the expression new Array()&rdquo;; needs to be fixed in ES3.1 (2) ES3/ES4 based review.
</p>

<p>
<strong>On posting the latest draft to the wiki</strong>
</p>

<p>
The latest draft has been uploaded to the wiki. This the draft as of 24 June 2008 - it has all the edits related to the statics on Object, the introduction of the &ldquo;Extensible&rdquo; property, the revised notation for JSON, and placeholders for Decimal - by next week we should try to have a technically complete draft - the draft may still have some place holders but it should still be enough to get circulated within TC39 as an artifact that can be reviewed - by the time we meet in Oslo, each place holder must have a supplementary doc that can be discussed F2F.
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;const&rsquo; needs to be introduced into the grammar - what does it mean to be a reserved word? - you cannot use it as a variable name - note that we have introduced the ability to use is as the name of a property though – const has letrec like  scoping – not subject to hoisting.
</p>

<p>
reformed scoping needs to be introduced - but for doing that we may want to introduce the notion of a &lsquo;block activation&rsquo; as an expository device
</p>

<p>
‘abc’[i] is using the ES3 like algorithm convention – can we use the new convention that eliminates the need for writing gotos – pratapL to investigate – also, for all new functionality we need to worry about argument conditioning – for e.g. if an algorithm expects to be handed an object, make sure we call toObject on the argument that is passed in.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Getters/Setters</strong>
</p>

<p>
Surface syntax spec from Kris looked Ok - need to ensure it is using the Meta APIs - Allen to check surface syntax integration.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Decimal</strong>
</p>

<p>
Decimal changes are isolated and can be done without impacting content in the rest of the doc - Sam can use the latest draft from the wiki as a starting point.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Strict mode</strong>
</p>

<p>
2 controversies coupled to each other – proposed ES4 wants to keep ‘with’ in their strict mode; ES3.1 wants to remove ‘with’ in its strict mode – need to be clear about the purpose of strict mode – the other is “what do we mean by subset?” – there was one formal definition from Lars, and Doug had called out a less formal notion – we may end up using Doug’s less formal notion (especially if we cannot resolve the ‘with’ issue).
</p>

<p>
Binary strict mode is naively limiting – each version may want to allow/limit specific features – strict mode allows users to say ‘I am subscribing to this particular subset, and I am aware of all its limitations’ – but if the subset is a moving target how do they do that? - sure, we can introduce a more elaborate mechanism – it would make it easier for us to not have to resolve arguments – but it would open up a larger combinatorial space of possibilities – the SunOS vs. MacOS problem; the former was highly customizable, however you invariably got it wrong; the latter was not customizable, but what you got was good enough to get the job done – more knobs need not mean better.
</p>

<p>
An elaborate mechanism enables chaos at the composability boundary – but how does it matter if you are opaquely including a module? – Caja will use ES3.1 strict mode for all uncajoled code – <acronym title="On the other hand">OTOH</acronym> an elaborate mechanism can enforce a subsetting profile – languages can now more directly enforce Caja like semantics.
</p>

<p>
‘use strict 3.1’ could be a potential syntax to turn on 3.1 level strict mode – with the possibility that the 3.1 may be replaced with a list – instead of tying it to the language version number, we can also just say something like ‘use strict a’ or ‘use strict 1’ – can also use <acronym title="Practical Extraction and Report Language">Perl</acronym>-style ‘use strict no with’ (where we mention the specific restriction we want to enable) – that seems a good idea too – in any case, named restriction sets for ES3.1 and proposed ES4 will be useful to discuss this proposal further.
</p>

<p>
Meeting adjourned.

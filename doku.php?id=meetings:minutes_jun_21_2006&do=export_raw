====== Discussion ======

  * Introduction of Douglas
    * Doug works for Yahoo, one of the world biggest users of JavaScript
    * He hopes to bring the users perspective to the design of the language
    * All agreed that this is a good thing and that the timing for his participation is good
    * We reviewed the major milestones posted on the [[meetings::meetings]] page
    * Doug expressed concern that the language won't get traction on the web if Microsoft doesn't implemement it in IE. MS is not represented on this call so this remains an open question
  * Nullability
    * There has been recent activity on the es4-discuss list regarding nullability
    * Lars wonders why all types don't include null, including Boolean, int, etc
    * Jeff (and Graydon?) say that goes against user expectation and actually complicates the language by giving Boolean three states, for example
    * Doug is concerned that we are throwing ES3 compatibility out the window with some of the ES4 features. Making Boolean non-nullable being one example
    * We explain that our intention is ES3 compatibility except for specific bug fixes. It is not clear how the current non-nullable types break compatibility with ES4.
    * Issues should be posted on the [[Proposals::Nullability]] page
  * Public Wiki
    * Jeff asks when do we want to re-export the wiki?
    * All agree that there hasn't been much activity and so there is not much pressure to do so
    * We tentatively agree to re-export after the next f2f at the end of July, if not sooner

====== About this directory ======

This directory (namespace) contains the draft specs under review or approved by the ES4-WG for inclusion in the final ES4 spec. They are posted in PDF, and HTML when possible. Differences between a draft and the previous draft are provided if relevant.

  * {{spec:grammar-d1.pdf|Grammar}}
  * {{spec:core-language-d1.pdf|Core Language}}



===== Draft 2 =====

[Note: Draft 2 HTML files for introduction, core-language and library where converted to PDF using Opera 9.27. Results may vary between browsers. HTML and PDF files for grammar were converted from the original XLS file; the HTML conversion did not handle the extended (greek) characters well but is usable]

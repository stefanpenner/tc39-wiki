Doug to look at Waldemar’s notes about RegExp lookaheads be assertions instead of atoms, and see what changes are required to the ES3.1 specification.

Any update on telnet access - no, none yet; we are still discussing this internally.

Should we open trac tickets for each of the issues discussed at the MTV F2F meeting? - many of them already have trac tickets - do whatever is easiest from the perspective of making the spec edits - as long as we can reconcile all the discussions into the spec we should be OK

Frequency of these phone meetings can be reduced - lets meets next Thurs - and then, we can meet on demand.

Next spec update to the wiki expected this Monday.

Brief discussion capability security, stack walk based security, and fault tolerant computing with some references to work by Martin Rinard of MIT.

Meeting adjourned.

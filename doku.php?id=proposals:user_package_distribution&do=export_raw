We should consider creating a standard distribution mechanism for user-submitted packages. This would be one of the biggest practical improvements to the current state of affairs for EcmaScript programming. Once users can reliably share their code, libraries grow incredibly quickly.

===== Difficult issues =====

  * compatibility between modes (see [[strict and standard modes]], [[clarification:compact profile]])
  * reliance on host environment's libraries and extensions
  * distribution mechanism, presumably over the net, but that makes sense for different environments for EcmaScript -- Flash, Jscript.NET, web browsers, Adobe Reader, ...
  * version management
    * no silent upgrades! (= [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell|DLL Hell]])
    * MS has a story for this in .NET (which I'm not too familiar with)
    * [[http://planet.plt-scheme.org|PLaneT]] has a story for this too
  * reliable hosting -- amongst all these powerhouse companies, I imagine someone could do something about this :)

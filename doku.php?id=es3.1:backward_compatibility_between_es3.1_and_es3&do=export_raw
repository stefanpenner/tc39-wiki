It should be possible to write programs that conditionally use new ES3.1 features such that such programs can also load and run on ES3 implementations. In order to accomplish this, new ES3.1 functionality cannot depend upon any new syntax. All new functionality needs to be introduced via methods and functions. The backward compatibility requirements between ES3.1 and ES4 are:
  * All syntactic changes in ES3.1 are non-functional in nature. Access to new functionality does not require use of syntax that does not exist in ES3.
  * A valid ES3.1 program that does not actually access, invoke, or otherwise reference at runtime any of the new native objects methods defined by ES3.1 shall run with the same results on an ES3 implementation.

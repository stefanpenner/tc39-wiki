===== Minutes =====

  * Line terminator normalization
    * [DC] are LS and PS used in the field. would like to remove LS and PS?
    * [WH] clearly normalization is the right thing to do. C# got it wrong. Length dependent on file format.
    * [JD] let's approve with a ticket to address doug's concern
    * [BE] "notes" is missing a rationale statement
    * Brendan to open ticket: http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/362

  * Line continuation in string
    * [BE] depends on normalization, but trivally
    * [WH] does this apply to RegExp too?
    * [BE] what do browsers do?
    * [BE] SM does not remove \ LF in RegExp
    * [BE] Safari gives parse error
    * [WH] wants them to affect RegExp too
    * other's agree
    * Brendan to open a ticket to address RegExp issue: http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/363

  * Triply quoted string literals
    * [WH] backslash LF allows multi-line strings
    * [BE] but not with embedded unescaped newlines, verbatim
    * [JD] Doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm for this feature
    * [DC] happy to remove this feature
    * [EA] thinks it should be more like python if we keep it
    * [BE] I'll spec it
    * [JD] it also needs to be implemented

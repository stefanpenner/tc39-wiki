<p>
The ECMA TC39 TG1 working group is working on ES4, as the next revision of ES3.
</p>

<p>
ES4 will be a major redesign of the ECMAScript language adding many new features and capabilities. Given the current broad adoption of ECMAScript and the large number of existing ES implementations it is reasonable to expect that for many years, while ES4 adoption grows, ES3 will remain in use as an important part of the world-wide-web infrastructure.  However, the ES3 specification is relatively old and would benefit from some maintenance. Since the publication of the ES3 specification in 1999 there has been feature drift between implementations and some cross-implementation compatibility issues have occurred because of deficiencies and ambiguities in the specification. In addition, usage experience and emerging best practices suggest a few feature additions and deprecations that would be of immediate value of many ES3 users.
</p>

<p>
This is a proposal to create a maintenance revision of the ES3 specification to specifically address issues of immediate concern to ES3 implementers and users. Within this proposal ES3.1 is used to refer to the maintenance revision. ES3.1 would be developed in parallel with ES4. The ES3.1 will supersede the ES3 specification but the ES4 specification will not supersede the ES3.1 specification. Both ES3.1 and ES4 specifications are expected to co-exist until such time as ES4 becomes the dominantly implemented version of ECMAScript.
</p>

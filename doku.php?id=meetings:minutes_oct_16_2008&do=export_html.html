<strong>Updates required for the JSON section (refer comments in the 13 Oct draft on the wiki).</strong>
</p>

<p>
Stringify needs to specify what do we need to detect, and what do we need to forbid - how do you specify any restrictions? - the object you are trying to serialize may only be a single object or a tree of objects; the root object must form a tree of objects - it is up to an implementation to make that happen; it is up to an implementation to prevalidate that or incrementally determine it as it is running - how about the following: the replacer maintains a hashtable that remembers every object it serializes; if it sees one it puts in an ibid entry into the hashtable, and proceeds; on the other end the reviver starts with an array of ibids, and progressively clears the array of the ibid entries as it sees duplicated objects in the JSON stream - that won&rsquo;t work, because the reviver is not called in the same order as the replacer was called! - ok, in that case instead of an ibid entry we could use a JSONPath - that won&rsquo;t work either, because the replacer does not have enough context up front to generate the path names - perhaps is best to specify that the object you are trying to serialize may only be a single object or a tree of objects; the root object must form a tree of objects - given that there is a JSON implementation in JavaScript, no matter how we specify it, it should not preclude implementing JSON in JavaScript itself.
</p>

<p>
What are we trying to prevent really? - prevent the creation of an infinite length string; that is a symptom of failure - problem similar to that of specifying factorial if it were a library function - what bounds would you apply on the input, and how would you specify that bound? - so, in that case what is the symptom of failure? - resource exhaustion - would prefer if we could precisely specify stringify - do we agree on the precondition that the object should be rooting a tree? - that is not a precondition strictly speaking; it is an input validation condition - for  implementations that incrementally determine if there is a cycle, what should happen? Do they stringify up to the point where there is a cycle, or, completely abort the stringification? - completely abort the stringification - but, what about side effects that might have been caused by property getters? - those will be observable.
</p>

<p>
Is there a reason why we want to under-specify this? - as an implementer I want the ability to optimize away un-observable behaviour - can you provide example of specification that prevented making such optimizations? - yes, the memory model in Java - what about the need for exact reproducibility of floating point computation in Java - Java serialization can handle cycles, though - perhaps we should take the position that JSON serializes records and not JavaScript objects - can we specify the order in which the properties get serialized? - the &lsquo;fast&rsquo; flag to Object.keys (used from the stringify method) can be used - if true, the keys are returned as-is, but if false, they keys are returned in sorted order - would prefer if the &lsquo;fast&rsquo; flag can be used to produce the same order as for-in; should be deterministic - but, we have been through this before … we don&rsquo;t want to specify enumeration order in for-in - why not? - because people have used various internal representations for Arrays and can no longer honour such a constraint (of enumeration order) without jumping through hoops; it goes back to the memory-model over specification of Java forcing implementers to forego optimization opportunities - Ok, but we would like to see some more concrete examples like these.
</p>

<p>
So, we are not agreed, yet, on how to specify what stringify should detect and what it should forbid - lets revisit at next meeting.
</p>

<p>
Meeting adjourned.

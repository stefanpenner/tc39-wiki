====== About this Directory ======

This page collects non-normative patterns and snippets of code offered as an agreed compromise to unify existing diverse practices, as [[https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2009-December/010361.html|suggested by Mike Wilson]], and to ease the transitions among EcmaScript versions.

[[Recommendations for Implementors]]



===== For use starting from ES3R =====

"ES3R" stands for "ES3 + Reality" and means "the intersection of ES3 approximations as deployed by existing major browsers". All code in this section should be compatible with ES3R, and useful on later EcmaScript versions.

  * [[conventions:isArrayLike]] detects whether an object should be considered array-like.
  * [[conventions:avoid strictness contagion]] -- Script concatenation can inadvertently overdeclare strictness. This is a pattern for avoiding that hazard.




==== platform feature detection patterns ====

Since ES3R will be around for a long time after ES5 is deployed, during the transition, any code compatible only with ES5 and forward (such as all the following sections) should be guarded by the following feature detection tests.

  * [[conventions:atLeastES5]] patterns for detecting whether the current platform supports at least ES5, or whether the current bit of code is at least ES5-strict.

  * [[conventions:CommonJS Adaptor]] is a lighweight self-contained (infrastructure-free) pattern for writing files that can be
    * used as [[http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.0|CommonJS modules]],
    * used as ES3R, ES5, ES5/strict, or SES browser-side scripts, or
    * losslessly concatenated together into larger scripts.

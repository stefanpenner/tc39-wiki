====== Modulo Operator ======

ECMAScript does not currently have a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation|modulo operator]]. Instead, it has a remainder operator ''%''. The result of remainder takes the sign of the dividend, not the divisor, so it does not have the nice limit-and-force-to-the-positive characteristics of modulo. Programs that use remainder in place of modulo are probably in error.

So it proposed that a modulo operator ''mod'' be added. The result of modulo takes the sign of the divisor, not the dividend.

The ''mod'' keyword is contextual, and backward-compatible only if productions in which it occurs have ''[no ''//LineTerminator//'' here]'' immediately to the left of ''mod''.

We may want ''div'' too, for integer division. We could even consider ''divmod'', returning a tuple:

<code javascript>
alert(12 divmod 5)  // #[2, 2]
</code>

I like that a lot. Assuming the grammar works out, I think it wins. There are other infix operators that could be added on a similar basis, like ''min'' and ''max''.

I will write this up later today. The ''min'' and ''max'' cases seem better done via the existing and variadic ''Math.min'' and ''Math.max'' functions than infix operators (e.g., ''Math.min(1,2,3,0)'' returns ''0''), but we can hash that out elsewhere.

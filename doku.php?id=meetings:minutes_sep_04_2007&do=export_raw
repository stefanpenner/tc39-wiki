===== Minutes =====

Meeting schedule:
  * Doug: meeting in October?
  * Jeff: maybe a good idea to go to a longer cycle and meet in November

Proposals.

Self types:
  * Cormac: Refer to the exact type of the object
  * Cormac: Utility is for methods on structural objects, where the method can reference the type of the containing object.  Useful for clone methods, iterators.
  * Jeff: Looks like this fills in a hole where the type would otherwise be * or something specific
  * Lars: A little concerned about limitations wrt how they function in (nominal) type hierarchies
  * Cormac: If we're using structural object types just as records and nominal types otherwise, we don't need self types much.  But what's open now is how we'll use the language.
  * Jeff: Use cases?  Preferably one that generalizes, since special-case features are often too costly.
  * Cormac: I'm not inclined to push it very hard...
  * Jeff: I think the proposal needs a compelling use case in order to survive; Brendan's chore.
  * See [[proposals:self type]] for use cases.

Program units:
  * Lars: some TBD's at the bottom, can you perhaps clean that up?
  * Graydon: a lot of syntax discussion here...
  * Graydon: I need to add some things about loading and dependencies here.
  * //Graydon will clean this up//

Maintenance of ES3:
  * Doug: Allen, Doug, and Pratap still working.  Pratap has been working on document about JScript deviations, they are also working on looking through ES3 to find implementation dependencies and similar
  * Jeff: Is there a pending revision of the proposal page?
  * Doug: There are pending changes.
  * Jeff: By the next f2f?
  * Doug: Yes (plan was before previous (cancelled) f2f)
  * //Doug, Allen, Pratap to produce update by next f2f//

Other.

Mailing list issue: is ''this'' allowed in static methods.
  * Jeff: public sentiment?  It's just a syntactic/semantic issue, no implementaiton problems.
  * Lars: give'm rope.
  * Jeff: Java chose not to...

Types:
  * Graydon: it's compiling... and it didn't explode semantically.

Math:
  * Lars: I ended up inventing some stuff for the math object, see spec/library.pdf and builtins/Math.es

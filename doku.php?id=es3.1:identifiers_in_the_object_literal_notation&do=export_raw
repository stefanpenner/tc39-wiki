//Description//: The ES3 Specification does not allow the use of reserved words as identifiers in the key/value pairs in the literal object notation. There is no reason to have this restriction. 

The following statement is currently illegal, producing syntax errors. It should be legal.

''var object = {function: false, goto: "home", var: 27};''

Relevant Goal: [[es3.1:es3.1_goals|1]]\\
Relevant Design Principle: [[es3.1:design_principles|2a, 2b]]\\

I'd like to point out, while I'm editing this short page, that many es3.1:... entries in the wiki fail to cite existing "Relevant ES4 proposal" pages. That's a shame, and I won't continue to add such citations after this one. It would be good for the es3.1 effort if that were done, since we agreed to accept an "ES3.1" proposal based on subsetting ES4.

I also think it's inefficient, exceedingly so, to break up existing proposals into many very short pages. All of es3.1 could fit in two screenfuls of one page. Why that was not done, I don't know, but I wish it were.

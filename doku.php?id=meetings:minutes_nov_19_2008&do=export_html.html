<strong>SES meeting</strong>
</p>

<p>
Work it out in committee instead of doing a competition? Cajita and Valija levels:  simple vs. current web-compatible. valija == Microsoft web sandbox They differ in that web sandbox passes out real references to objects but uses the current context to limit what you can access on them (an <acronym title="Access Control List">ACL</acronym> paradigm). Valija restricts reference passing (a capability paradigm). In web sandbox the host can create channels between two sandboxes, but only primitive values can be passed over a channel. Valija: all contexts see the own properties of an object in the same way. They see the basic protype properties in the same way but differ if one monkey-patches a prototype; only that context sees that patch. Jacaranda: pure object capability Recent web sandbox discovered and fixed security bugs:  arguments.prototype.caller.caller to get at the Function constructor; Function() to execute arbitrary code (didn&rsquo;t realize that it did the same as new Function()).
</p>

<p>
Mozilla monitors greater than cubic complexity in regular expresssions.
</p>

<p>
Doug Crockford: Get rid of all native prototypes, constructor fields, etc.
</p>

<p>
Problem with catch-alls/interceptors. Assertion was made that an interceptor is just like putting a getter and a setter on every property. However, this behaves materially differently for prototype objects: just the mere presence of a getter or a setter on a prototype prevents one from writing to create expandos in the derived object.
</p>

<p>
How do multiple contexts, as implemented by prototype inheritance on the built-in objects, interact with getters/setters and introspection?
</p>

<p>
other issues with interceptors are the ability to masquerade as other objects and run arbitrary user code for tests such as HasProperty. Also, the current spec assumes that the internal operations such as HasProperty, Put, etc. are consistent with each other.
</p>

<p>
How would iteration work with interceptors?
</p>

<p>
Relying on an initial script to lock down/delete nasty properties from the global object + having eval do the evaluation in a virgin copy of the global object = oops!
</p>

<p>
More support for a stratified virtualization system where the outer program can do an &ldquo;eval&rdquo; in a virtual and separate inner universe with hooks for what happens on various property lookups, calls, etc.
</p>

<p>
Brendan: Catch-all introspection is extraordinarily difficult due to recursion suppresion (a simple flag won&rsquo;t work because the handlers may need to look up other things) and related complexities.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want to go through that again.
</p>

<p>
New name: &ldquo;webfoot&rdquo; for the concept of providing hooks for sandboxing ad code.
</p>

<p>
Some folks want to vastly reduce the scope of or delay <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> 5 to make securing it easier.

<strong>Spec review (Wednesday, Thursday)</strong>
</p>

<p>
5.2 - &ldquo;step my specify&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
7.1 - &ldquo;format control characters may be used in identifiers, ...&rdquo;:  No they can&rsquo;t, according to section 7.6.
</p>

<p>
7.3 - &ldquo;except that line terminators that are preceded by an escape sequence may occur&rdquo;:  &ldquo;preceded&rdquo; is not the right meaning here.  &ldquo;part of&rdquo;?
</p>

<p>
7.3 - The production
</p>
<pre class="code">LineTerminator :: ... | &lt;CR&gt; | &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</pre>

<p>
is ambiguous.  Probably the simplest fix is to change it to:
</p>
<pre class="code">LineTerminator :: ... | &lt;CR&gt; [lookahead isn't &lt;LF&gt;] | &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</pre>

<p>
 Even then having &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; there causes trouble for things like its use in 15.10.2.6, 15.10.2.8, and 15.10.2.12.
</p>

<p>
7.5 - Token :: ReservedWord | Identifier | IdentifierName doesn&rsquo;t make sense
</p>

<p>
7.8.4 - &ldquo;All Unicode characters may appear literally in a string literal except for the closing quote character, backslash, carriage return, and line feed. Any character may appear in the form of an escape sequence.&rdquo; This is wrong about the other line terminators. Cannot have &lt;LS&gt; and &lt;PS&gt; in a string literal; the only way to put them in is using their Unicode values.
</p>

<p>
7.8.5 - Allowing /[/]/:  This would be a change in this section.  It&rsquo;s already allowed by the chapter 15 grammar. /(.(/ is a syntax error in Mozilla and ES3. Leave it that way.
</p>

<p>
8 - Can Property Descriptors and Property Identifiers be stored as user-visible properties of objects? The last sentence seems to imply that they can.
</p>

<p>
8.6.1 - &ldquo;change the property to being an&rdquo; &rArr; &ldquo;change the property to be an&rdquo; &ldquo;operator in section 11.4.1, and the&rdquo;:  remove comma.
</p>

<p>
8.6.2 - add [[ThrowablePut]] in the first paragraph after the table. &ldquo;The value of the [[Class]] property of a host object may be any value&rdquo;: Do you mean any string?
</p>

<p>
8.6.2.2 - &ldquo;explicit control over the handling of invalid property store&rdquo;: Do you really mean &ldquo;store&rdquo; here?  &ldquo;stores&rdquo; makes more sense.
</p>

<p>
8.6.2.8 - &ldquo;if O is a String object it has&rdquo;:  add &ldquo;then&rdquo; before &ldquo;it&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
8.6.2.10 - Add comma before &ldquo;the following steps&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
8.6.9 - get rid of the SameValue test from 10.a.ii.1. Setting the same value twice must be an error.
</p>

<p>
8.6.10 - change [[ThrowablePut]] to [[FalliblePut]]
</p>

<p>
8.10 - The nomenclature is too inconsistent. Sometimes you refer to property descriptor properties as &ldquo;writable&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;{value: 42, writable: false, configurable: true}&rdquo;, and sometimes as &ldquo;[[Writable]]&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;Desc.[[Writable]]&rdquo; in 8.10.2). Are these are two different things just as x.prototype and x.[[Prototype]] are different?
</p>

<p>
Also, Desc.[[Writable]] doesn&rsquo;t make sense because there is no such internal property listed in the table of all internal properties used in this specification in 8.6.2.
</p>

<p>
Data types from 8.10 are used in earlier sections of chapter 8 before they are defined here. Can&rsquo;t figure out which order to read this chapter in, as text from 8.10 subtly modifies the interpretation of 8.6.2.  Solving this problem by moving this content to or near 8.6.2 would help solve the others as well.
</p>

<p>
Can a Property Descriptor include both [[setter]] and [[value]] fields?  8.10 is ambiguous on that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;(name, descriptor), where name is a string and descriptor &ldquo;:  italicize &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;descriptor&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
8.10.4 - &ldquo;the following steps are taken:, the following steps are taken:&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t repeat. Don&rsquo;t repeat <img src="lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" align="middle" alt=":-)" /> The Note here should be a normative part of the preamble. Otherwise step 4 doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Be consistent about italicization of Desc.
</p>

<p>
8.10.5 - Call the formal parameter something other than &ldquo;Desc&rdquo; here.  It&rsquo;s confusing to use the same name for both objects and property descriptors.
</p>

<p>
9 - Decimal support broken in most of the tables.
</p>

<p>
9.3 - ToDecimal on a Number gives the Number unchanged? ToNumber on a Decimal is not defined.
</p>

<p>
9.8 - ToString on a Decimal is not defined in the table. The algorithm only works on Number values.  +0, -0, etc. are Number values, not Decimal values.  Also, it internally references conversions to Numbers.
</p>

<p>
9.3.1 - ToDecimal on a string results in a Number.  Also, it optionally drops significant digits after the 20th.
</p>

<p>
10.2 - &ldquo;functrions&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
10.2.1 - &ldquo;binding can not be set throw a TypeError exception&rdquo;:  Missing comma.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.1 - &ldquo;a ECMAScrpt&rdquo;:  a &rarr; an and fix spelling error
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A declarative environment record binding the set of identifiers defined by the declarations contained within its scope.&rdquo;:  Not a sentence.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.1.x - Be consistent about spaces before the opening parenthesis of formal parameters.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.1.6 - &ldquo;The S argument is ignored because strict mode deoes not change the meaning of setting bindings in declarative environment records have .&rdquo;: Ah, that&rsquo;s what &ldquo;S&rdquo; is for? You didn&rsquo;t explain this earlier when S was first mentioned in the other methods. Also, fix grammar errors.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.2.x - Same comments as above.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.2.1 - This will mean that having bindings in the prototype will prevent one from building ones in the leaf object. Step 4. If Result(3) is false or the binding for N in Result(1) is an uninitialized immutable binding, then&rdquo;:  What&rsquo;s an uninitialized immutable binding here?  Result(3) is an object, not an environment. Objects have properties, not bindings.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.2.5 - This will always error out in DefineOwnProperty.
</p>

<p>
10.2.1.2.6:  Step 3: If the binding for N in Result(1) is a mutable binding, then&rdquo;:  What is a mutable binding?  Result(1) is an object, not an environment. Step 4. Else this must be an attempt to change the value of an immutable binding so throw a TypeError exception.&rdquo;:  This doesn&rsquo;t follow.  For example, just because Result(1) has no binding doesn&rsquo;t mean that its prototype doesn&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
10.2.2.1 - &ldquo;called with a lexical environment lex, identifier string, name, and boolan flag strict the following steps are performed&rdquo;:  Due to several grammar errors (an extra comma and a missing one) this doesn&rsquo;t mean what it&rsquo;s supposed to.
</p>

<p>
10.2.2.x - &ldquo;is call&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;is called&rdquo;.  Lots of other typos as well.
</p>

<p>
10.2.2.4 - There is no current lexical environment bound around the declaration of PopEnvironnmentRecord.
</p>

<p>
10.3 - &ldquo;to tract the execution&rdquo; (?) What is VariableEnvironment for?  It&rsquo;s never used in the spec, except for a mention in 12.2 which is a bug and shouldn&rsquo;t be there.
</p>

<p>
10.3.2 - Can&rsquo;t do the arguments object this way.  It&rsquo;s incompatible with ES3 for multiple arguments sharing the same name. You also don&rsquo;t want users extracting the getters and setters out of the arguments array, etc.  Also, the notion of scope in which the getters and setters are eval&rsquo;d is fuzzy at best and can cause problems if other definitions ever shadow the parameter names.
</p>

<p>
isArray(arguments) should return true
</p>

<p>
10.3.3 - &ldquo;Variables and functions declared in ECMAScript code evaluate in the execution context are added as bindings in the that environment record.&rdquo; (?) Step 1. Let env be the running execution context&rsquo;s VariableEnvironment.&rdquo; How do those get created? Section 10.4 should come first.
</p>

<p>
10.4 - This is still confusing. What creates execution contexts? There is no such step in the algorithms here.
</p>

<p>
11.1.5 - This means that I can override a getter with a value property or specify two getters for the same property even in strict mode.  We had agreed that strict mode disallowed such things.
</p>

<p>
11.2.1 - &ldquo;where &lt;identifier-name-string&gt; is a string literal containing the same sequence of characters as the IdentifierName.&rdquo;; the meaning is ambiguous in the presence of escape codes.
</p>

<p>
11.3.1, 11.3.2 - All four of the return statements are wrong in different ways. Some return the preincremented value. Some return an lvalue instead of an rvalue.
</p>

<p>
11.4.1 - Agreed to change this to always throw if step 5 is reached in strict mode. This prevents &ldquo;delete x&rdquo; from deleting a global variable.
</p>

<p>
11.4.1.1 - delete a.b	 (x+y) would cause inappropriate semicolon insertion in strict mode.  Also, MemberExpression doesn&rsquo;t accomplish much here, since you can still write delete (4). Fix:  Remove grammar restriction altogether.
</p>

<p>
11.4.3 - host objects cannot masquerade as &ldquo;function&rdquo;. Host objects that don&rsquo;t implement [[Call]] cannot answer as &ldquo;function&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
11.5 - What&rsquo;s the corresponding Decimal operation? There are a bunch of different remainder options.
</p>

<p>
11.8.5 - Treating Unicode character codes as Decimal numbers.  Which characters have Unicode numbers that are Numbers, and which ones have Unicode numbers that are Decimals? If you fix this and apply the same contagion rules as for +, -, *, etc., then you&rsquo;ll have the issue that 1e-400m &gt; 0m but 1e-400m &gt; 0 is false. The contagion rules need rethinking.
</p>

<p>
11.9.3 - The contagion here is from Number to Decimal.  This is inconsistent with +, -, *, etc., where the contagion is from Decimal to Number. It should be the same for all arithmetic operations.
</p>

<p>
11.9.6 - Don&rsquo;t need to call ToDecimal on values that are already Decimals.
</p>

<p>
11.13.1.1 - The strict mode restrictions are ambiguous.  What happens in this case, where g does not exist?
</p>

<p>
g = (function(){throw &ldquo;foo&rdquo;})();
</p>

<p>
What about this?
</p>

<p>
g = eval(&rdquo;var g = 5; 2&rdquo;);
</p>

<p>
 Agreed that 12.1.1 is gone. Agreed that there are no strict mode restrictions on var placement. Agreed to allow redundant var x declarations.
</p>

<p>
Agreed that in strict mode we disallow name conflicts within the same (hoisted) scope of: parameter vs. parameter
</p>

<p>
parameter vs. var
</p>

<p>
parameter vs. function
</p>

<p>
function vs. var
</p>

<p>
function vs. function
</p>

<p>
Implementations are free to report these as errors early, at the same time as syntax errors. This will require adding cases to chapter 16.
</p>

<p>
12.2 - This breaks ES3 and existing practice. Consider with(o) {var x = 3} if o.x exists and has the value 7.  This code currently sets o.x to 3; the proposed change would leave it at 7. 
</p>

<p>
13 - &ldquo;code code&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
14 - The syntax of the use strict directive is incompatible with the lexer grammar.  There is no such separate token. What happens if someone escapes a character within the use strict directive token? The spaces before &ldquo;use&rdquo; and at the end are mandatory? Is it mandatory that the semicolon follow without an intervening space?  How does the semicolon interact with semicolon insertion?
</p>

<p>
Strict directives are ambiguous with statements.
</p>

<p>
There should be no &ldquo;opt&rdquo; after UseStrictDirective&rsquo;s definition.
</p>

<p>
15 - Debate about whether to change the spec to require implementations to ignore extra arguments passed to built-in methods (5th paragraph of chapter 15). This would interfere with arity checking in future variants of strict-arity mode because currently programs that pass extra arguments are non-portable, while they would become portable if the spec mandates that extra arguments are ignored. Also, there are some methods on which we have a placeholder for locale objects. Mozilla makes use of an extra argument in its string replace function. Agreed to revert to ES3 text. But remove the statement that an implementation is permitted (but not required) to throw an exception.
</p>

<p>
Some of the &ldquo;Strict Mode Restrictions&rdquo; paragraphs are normative (15.1.2.1.1).  Some are informative (11.13.1.1).  We need to clearly distinguish the two. Perhaps we can move all the strict mode restrictions to an informative annex. Or, make them &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; instead of giving them their own section number – &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; are meant to be informative.
</p>

<p>
15.2.3.14 - remove the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; parameter. If an implementation defines an order for &ldquo;for-in&rdquo;, this should follow the same order.
</p>

<p>
15.4.4.11 - sort is broken by getters that return , setters, read-only properties, non-configurable properties if there are holes, non-extensible objects, etc. need to explicitly specifiy the “this” value passed in. the default this value should be undefined. All the &ldquo;Call&rdquo; should change to &ldquo;Call the [[Call]] ...&rdquo; Also this algo seems to be broken in the presense of getters/setters, readonly properties, and non-extesnible objects. All legacy algorithms from ES3 need to be reviewed  - many of the algo might be written with the naïve assumption that they are operating on data properties that are mutable.
</p>

<p>
Decimal is out because the spec isn&rsquo;t ready and there are some problems that are not small spec errors &ndash; generic behavior of functions, etc.
</p>

<p>
 The Kona draft needs to be patched  with the email update to the statement grammar  and strict mode restrictions sent out by pratapL
</p>

<p>
Agreed to remove the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; parameter of Object.keys and take out the sort.  If an implementation defines a specific order for for-in then Object.keys must return the same order.
</p>

<p>
15.4.4.11: sort is broken by getters that return inconsistent values, setters, read-only properties, non-configurable properties if there are holes, non-extensible objects, etc. Agreed to fix this somehow; it won&rsquo;t necessarily be easy. Will also need to verify that all of the other algorithms in chapter 15 still work in the presence of getters, setters, read-only properties, non-configurable properties, and non-extensible objects.
</p>

<p>
With &ldquo;const&rdquo; missing, the changes to chapter 8 for attribute description become premature standardization and should be cut. The problem is that these changes are likely to be incompatible with ES-Harmony due to the same logic that cut &ldquo;const&rdquo;. Without &ldquo;const&rdquo; we have no way of testing this.
</p>

<p>
Allen says that there is no conflict between the reflection <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> and const.  We&rsquo;ll likely approach it in Harmony by not creating any properties in the global object until the const is initialized.  All agreed to verify that const (as planned for Harmony) is not broken by ES3.1.
</p>

<p>
Reflection leakage:  For Harmony we&rsquo;ll look at ways to seal abstraction leaks (interposing hidden levels in prototype hierarchies of user-defined classes, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Chapter 16: Extend list of errors that can be signaled early to include some strict mode violations (duplicate parameter names, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Chapter 8 and 10:  Get rid of hidden state that&rsquo;s implicit in the algorithms but not exposed in the data structure. Introduce concepts before using them. Go through Waldemar&rsquo;s list of comments from before the meeting.
</p>

<p>
bind behavior:  Should bind create only a call or both a call and a construct bound property?  We decided to stick to last meeting&rsquo;s decision of creating both a call and a construct bound property.  (If it were just call, then the argument for adding bind to the language at all weakens since it would do duplicate what the frameworks already do but perhaps slightly less compatibly.)

<p>
 What is webfoot? Performance optimization for Valija-like things. Whitelisting flag, interceptors, catchalls?
</p>

<p>
How is lambda useful except for code gemerators? It&rsquo;s hazardous because it&rsquo;s too easy to leak completion values that were not intended to be returned. Also it&rsquo;s hard to refactor lambdas if it&rsquo;s not clear whether their return values are intentional or accidental.
</p>

<p>
classes: (class and instance) * (const and mutable variables, methods, and getters/setters) * (public and private) + constructor? instance private vs. class private class private would require a different syntax for accessing the private value &ldquo;length&rdquo; vs. the length of some unrelated object that was passed in in an argument.

===== Next face-to-face meeting =====

San Francisco, December 14 & 15 Hosted by Adobe

===== Discussion =====

  * meaning of use numeric pragmas discussed
  * meaning of type annotations, and strict and standard modes discussed
    * type annotations are not implementation optional because they affect runtime behavior (conversions,errors)
    * programs that compile without errors in strict mode have the same behavior if compiled in standard mode
  * status update of reference implementation
    * The expression parser is mostly complete
      * expression closures (''function (x,y) x(),y()'') require the outer list context {allowList,noList} to be passed down to the function expression production
      * the idea of pattern has been expanded to include simple patterns, which are postfix expressions in general and identifiers in binding lists
    * we need to stabilize the definition of the AST types before significant progress can be made on the typechecker and evaluator
    * it is our goal to do that before next tuesday's phone call
    * Michael is still wrestling with ML-Lex. It generates code that causes the sml compiler to silently fail. He hasn't given up hope yet
    * Steven has checked in a first cut of the buildin Array class (in mtn repository: ./builtins/Array.es) in ES4. It needs to be reviewed

  ClassElement :
    MethodDefinition
    "static" MethodDefinition

This proposal creates a syntatic mechanism for defining methods on the
constructor of a class creating using the ''class'' syntax.

Modify the Runtime Semantics of ''ClassDefinitionEvaluation'' by inserting the
following before Step 15 (of the December 21, 2012 draft):

  - Let //classMethods// be "static" ''MethodDefinitions'' of ''ClassBody''
  - For each //MethodDefinition// //c// in order for //classMethods//
    - Perform __Property Definition Evaluation__ for //c// with argument //constructor//

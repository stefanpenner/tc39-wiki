====== Line terminator normalization ======

  NAME:        "Line terminator normalization"
  CATEGORY:    Lexical conventions (E262-3 ch 7)
  SOURCES:     Reference [1]
  SPEC AUTHOR: Lars
  STATUS:      Last call (2008-03-08)
  REVIEWS:     es4-discuss; phone conference; tickets
  IMPLEMENTED: RI (not LS/PS yet); Tamarin+ESC (not LS/PS yet)

====== Changelog ======

2008-03-06 / lth: based on [2] and email discussion, decided to normalize LS and PS as well.

====== Description ======


The character sequence CRLF, and the single characters CR, LS, and PS, are all converted to a single LF
character, in all source contexts, before tokenization takes place.


====== Notes ======

Normalization is compatible with ES3 because it is invisible to the program outside string and regular expression literals and because none of those characters are legal in string and regular expression literals in ES3.  See [2].


====== Definitions ======

  LF=U+000A
  CR=U+000D
  LS=U+2028
  PS=U+2029

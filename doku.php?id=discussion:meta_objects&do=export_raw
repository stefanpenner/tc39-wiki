====== Use of structural types ======

I am worried that the use of structural types in this proposals will not be good for implementations that wish to make the (required!) meta-objects immutable, since those implementations will have to support not just an Array (say), but also a special variant of Array that can be immutable.

Since we have enumeration now, how about changing the types of ''fieldList'', ''typeArgs'', ''valArgs'', etc to be some sort of enumerable, opaque object?

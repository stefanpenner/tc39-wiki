Meeting time: 11:00 Pacific

===== Agenda =====

  * Introductions, Maciej Stachowiak.
  * Organize this agenda to fit in one hour (Mozilla people have a stop at noon).
  * From last meeting:
    * Go through [[proposals:proposals]].
      * Start with [[proposals:builtin_classes|Ed’s proposal]], study it before the meeting.
        * Particular attention to class Class.
    * Go through [[http://wiki.mozilla.org/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?do=recent&id=|recent changes]].
  * Hand out action items by end of meeting
    * so we can parallelize more and avoid serialing through long call-in meetings.

===== Notes =====

  * Lars, Graydon, Blake, Brendan, Jeff, Dan Smith, Francis, Ed.
  * Going over [[proposals:proposals|mid-level issues]].
    * Graydon annotating status on these
    * Everyone to comment on [[proposals:iterators and generators]]
    * Brendan to do something on enumerability
  * Ed's Edition 3 in Edition 4 proposal
    * ''this:T'' for unbound method declarations, needed for function type signatures too
      * But what does it mean, and why is it used outside of ''dynamic prototype function''?
      * Two issues: where the function is stored, how it binds ''this''
      * Assumption is that it's not useful to bind ''this'' only to a prototype, so ''prototype'' unbinds ''this'' in addition to saying where the function is stored
      * Perhaps use more attributes like ''{DD,DE,RO}'' to talk about where-bound and how-this-constrained

//Description//: This is useful when making recursive calls within an anonymous function â€“ however, it is better to use named functions.

It is better to write:

<code>
     function foo () {
         ... foo() ...
     }
</code>

than
<code>
     function () {
         ... arguments.callee() ...
     }
</code>

====== float32x4 ======

An immutable value type that contains 4 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point numbers. Values are mapped to lanes labelled "x", "y", "z", and "w". Note that "w" is the 4th lane.

===== float32x4 Constructors =====

After a float32x4 has been constructed. Lane values for "x", "y", "z", and "w" will be initialized.

** float32x4(x, y, z, w) **

This operation performs the following steps:

  - The result of ToNumber(x) is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "x" lane.
  - The result of ToNumber(y) is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "y" lane.
  - The result of ToNumber(z) is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "z" lane.
  - The result of ToNumber(w) is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "w" lane.

** float32x4.zero() **

  - 0.0 is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "x" lane.
  - 0.0 is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "y" lane.
  - 0.0 is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "z" lane.
  - 0.0 is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "w" lane.

** float32x4.splat(v) **

  - The result of ToNumber(v) is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and stored in the "x", "y", "z", and "w" lanes.


====== uint32x4 ======

An immutable value type that contains 4 32-bit unsigned integer numbers. Values are mapped to lanes “x”, “y”, “z”, and “w”.

====== ''has'' infix operator ======

In ES3, the ''hasOwnProperty'' method is used to determine if a name refers to an own property of an object. This is not only awkward, but it can fail in a surprising way when the name being considered is ''"hasOwnProperty"''. The workaround is ''Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, name)'', which is awful.

So it is proposed that a ''has'' operator be introduced that can reliably produce a boolean indicating the name's relationship with the object.

    object has name

I like this in principle, but calling it ''has'' when it's semantically testing "has own" is misleading. Maybe ''owns''? Or flip it around like ''in'' but all it ''own''?

    object owns name
    name own object

Given the [[harmony:proxies]] use of ''has'' to match ''get'' and include delegated as well as "own" properties, I agree with Dave.

    object owns name

is pretty sweet by itself, but unlike ''in'' it does not generate a loop form: ''for (object owns var name) ...'' is backward in two ways.

We could keep object on the right and use a preposition:

    name on object

Is there a better proposition than ''on''?

====== About this directory ======

This directory (namespace) contains the individual feature specs under review by the ES4-WG for inclusion in the final ES4 spec.

  * Don't edit something here unless you expect everyone agrees on it.
    * See the [[proposals:proposals]] area for ideas-in-progress.
    * Record open issues in [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org|http://bugs.ecmascript.org]]

  * **Do** edit something here if you see a typo or poor language.
    * The whole point of a wiki is to make group editing as simple as possible.

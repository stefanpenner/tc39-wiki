===== Agenda =====

  * Adoption of the agenda
  * Approval of the [[meetings:minutes_nov_08_2007|November 08th minutes]].  (Link to private minutes will be posted later.)
  * Date and place of next meeting(s)
    * Next f2f is on 24-25 January 2008, in Mountain View (at Google)
  * Process issues
    * Agenda for meetings.  The Editor proposes that the agenda for a meeting (whether phone conference or f2f) shall be completed no later than the Friday before the meeting.
    * Resolution of conflicts in meeting minutes.  AWB proposes that any correction to the minutes that turns out to be contentious be resolved by allowing short (50 words suggested) position statements to be inserted into the minutes at the point of contention.
    * Deadlines for tickets.  The Editor proposes that once a ticket makes it to the agenda and contains a clear proposal for resolution, then the ticket shall be acted on within three weeks.  Actions are "approve" and "reject"; however the group can decide that the proposal is not clear and send the ticket back for further processing.  The purpose of this rule is to prevent technical matters from being stalled indefinitely because group members need more time to consider it.
  * Action items from the f2f
    * Recap of any action items and possibly their deadlines
  * Open issues on which there is probably not much disagreement

    * [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/276|#276]]: Specific rules of ''this'' propagation
    * [[http://bugs.ecmascript.org/ticket/282|#282]]: Removing restrictions on "use" and "import"

  * Adjournment




===== Public minutes =====

  * #247
    * We're not in agreement on whether a type parameter can be referenced by static properties
    * "One static for the class (CF/GH) or one static per instantiation (LH/BE)"
    * GH: previous agreement about this was at Adobe early 2007, and said there was one static for the parameterized class
    * => Action: LH to write up a specific ticket for that
    * => This ticket deferred until that issue has been resolved [no deadline]
  * #274
    * => Resolved, we won't change parseInt/parseFloat
  * #275
    * AWB: the small (Number.parse) and big (int.parse, etc) proposals depend on error handling behavior, etc.
    * => Action: BE and PP to work out details of an int.parse etc proposal to see where they can take it
  * The rest of the open issues deferred until next week (ran out of time)
